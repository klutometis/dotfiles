# Aider Configuration File - OpenAI Profile
# See: https://aider.chat/docs/config/aider_conf.html
# Profile-specific settings for OpenAI models

# Primary model for complex tasks and code generation
# Using GPT-5 Mini (fast, cost-efficient with reasoning support)
model: gpt-5-mini

# Weak model for simple tasks like commit messages
# Using GPT-5 Nano (fastest, most cost-efficient)
weak-model: gpt-5-nano

# Enable high reasoning effort for OpenAI models
# OpenAI models use reasoning-effort (not thinking-tokens like Claude/Gemini)
# Options: low, medium, high
reasoning-effort: high

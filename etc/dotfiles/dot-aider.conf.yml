# Chat mode setting: "ask" mode waits for approval before making changes
# Alternative: "code" mode makes changes immediately
chat-mode: ask

# Enable automatic testing after changes to create compile/bug-fix cycles
# Aider will auto-detect test commands or prompt when needed
# You can also set test-cmd explicitly: test-cmd: "pytest" or "make test"
auto-test: true

# Disable aider's built-in shell command suggestions (default: true)
# We're using the shell MCP server instead, which provides shell command execution

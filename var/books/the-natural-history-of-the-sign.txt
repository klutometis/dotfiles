Although this book was written in the course of 2020, the impulse to write it
stems from many sources and from many parts of my career.
Firstly, I must thank my philosophy tutor at Magdalen College Oxford,
Dr Ralph Walker, who inspired my lifelong interest in philosophy, and Professor
David Wiggins who, at Birkbeck College in the 1980s, introduced me to the work
of Leibniz.
I also owe a debt of gratitude to my professional colleagues who encouraged
my interest in signs, and their applications, throughout my career. In particular,
I should mention Gill Ereaut, Malcolm Evans, and the late Ginny Valentine, in
this respect.
I would also like to acknowledge the support of my two PhD supervisors at
UCL – Professor Andrew Burn and Professor John Vorhaus. Whilst many would
have cautioned against an attempt to bring the two worlds of German Idealism
and semiotics together, their faith in me was fundamental in facilitating my
research.
Finally, I would like to thank my editors, Professor Paul Cobley and Professor Kalevi Kull, who suggested that this book should be written and who have
provided me with their unstinting support throughout the process leading to its
publication. Without their help, it would never have been realised.

Introduction: Hegel, Peirce, and Vygotsky
From the distant standpoint of the twenty-first century, it is difficult to grasp
the full impact of Hegel’s philosophy on nineteenth century thought. Between
Hegel and ourselves stand successive philosophical developments which have
created distance from him. The ‘analytic’ tradition, the ‘linguistic turn’, the
emergence of structuralism, and the rise of social constructivist models of
meaning making, have engendered layers of misunderstanding which have
tended to marginalise Hegel and given rise to many of the ‘myths’ (Stewart
1996) which surround his philosophical legacy. But Hegel’s epistemological
work clearly deserves consideration for its far-reaching influence on nineteenth
century thought. Building on Kant, Hegel proposed a model of concept formation which addressed the flaws of Kant’s earlier work. He proposed, in turn, a
model of his own offering an alternative account of how the human mind ascends from its basic perceptions to a system of interrelated concepts. The latter,
he contended, forms a platform for synthetic knowledge of the world.
The central argument of this essay is that Charles Sanders Peirce, writing in
the latter parts of the nineteenth century, was heavily influenced by this Hegelian model of concept formation. But Peirce believed that he identified several
errors in Hegel’s approach, and, like his German predecessor before him, proposed an improved system of his own. He rejected certain elements of Hegel’s
dialecticism, and, in its place, proposed that signs, acting in combination with
each other, form the building blocks of empirical knowledge. This essay will
argue that this philosophical position – a cardinal aspect of Peircean semiotics –
has been given insufficient recognition in the secondary literature. By exploring
these underlying similarities with Hegel, it is possible to shed considerable light
on Peirce’s semiotic thought.
A second and related theme of this essay is the impact of Hegel’s philosophy upon the Russian psychologist, Lev Vygotsky. Writing half a century later
than Peirce, Vygotsky also owed much to Hegel’s account of concept development. As a psychologist, rather than a philosopher, he was, in some respects,
further away from Hegel than was Peirce. Moreover, Vygotsky’s focus was also
narrower; he did not question some of Hegel’s deeper epistemological concerns. But Vygotsky’s model of concept formation still displays many Hegelian
characteristics, and these bring him close to the revised account of Peircean semiotics that will be proposed here. The convergences that exist between Peirce
and Vygotsky will, therefore, form a recurrent theme in this discussion. An understanding of their shared Hegelian heritage greatly enhances our comprehension of them both and the connections that exist between them.

Introduction: Hegel, Peirce, and Vygotsky

This essay is aimed, therefore, at both semioticians who have an interest in
Peirce, and educationalists who have an interest in learning theory. It is also
hoped, however, that this analysis will also appeal to a third group – that of
professional philosophers. Hegel’s reputation as a philosopher has been slowly
recovering from its relative neglect in the mid-twentieth century, but the following comparison of Hegel with Peirce and Vygotsky may help to demonstrate how
he influenced modern semiotics. Indeed, it can be argued that the relative demise
of Hegel’s reputation in the twentieth century is one of the reasons why misunderstandings of Peirce and Vygotsky still exist in the secondary literature. Without the guiding template of Hegelian thought, both thinkers tend to be viewed
through philosophical prisms that only emerged in the twentieth century and
these have created significant barriers to our understanding of them.
Paradoxically, these historical prisms have also resulted in divisions being
drawn between semiotics and philosophy. Peirce would have been more than
dismayed by the way in which modern semiotics has become divorced from
philosophy because he envisaged semiotics as offering solutions to the philosophical problems of his age. In contrast, twentieth century semiotics has
shifted away from mainstream philosophy and towards a greater cultural orientation. This has been to the detriment of both Peirce’s own legacy and modern
philosophy.
But to begin our discussion, it is important to outline the ways in which
Hegelian thought has been generally interpreted in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. As such, it will be possible to grasp the philosophical distance
that exists between the context in which Peirce and Vygotsky were writing and
modern interpretations of their work. Contemporary semioticians are often distanced from this philosophical heritage by the tectonic shifts in philosophy
which took place at the beginning of the twentieth century, and which were, in
themselves, the result of the widespread rejection of Hegelian philosophy.

The historical trajectory of Hegelian thought
In his ‘Critique of Pure Reason’, Kant argued that the empiricist model of knowledge, established in the works of John Locke and David Hume, was deeply
flawed. In response, Kant claimed that the human mind, in understanding the
world, contributes something to the activity of experience itself. Our perceptions
provide our raw ‘intuitions’, but the mind brings to bear its own mental categories to make sense of the world. As Kant stated (Kant [1781] 1998: 193–194), “without sensibility no object would be given to us, and without understanding none

would be thought. Thoughts without content are empty, intuitions without concepts are blind”.
It was upon this platform that Kant claimed that synthetic knowledge of
the empirical world is possible. But Kant’s contemporaries quickly highlighted
that his position had several important flaws. Firstly, it placed a very significant
weight on the mind’s ability to know the nature of its own intuitions. Both
Hegel and Peirce rejected the assumption that such intuitive knowledge is possible. Secondly, Kant’s system still retained an implicit dualism – formalised in
Kant’s distinction between the ‘phenomenal’ and the ‘noumenal’ worlds. The
former comprises direct perceptions, whilst the latter exists ‘beyond’ the mind’s
intuitions in a way which is unknowable. This division was viewed as a major
weakness in Kant’s overall system. If it were allowed to stand, then Kant’s
claim to synthetic knowledge would be founded on little more than a combination of the mind’s perceptions and its internal mental categories. In this context, Kant’s claim to synthetic knowledge would remain forever anchored in the
phenomenal world.
In the early decades of the nineteenth century, Hegel sought to address
these problems with a philosophical system based on a dialectical approach to
knowledge. This cognitive template, discussed in detail in chapter four, was
employed by Hegel to overcome both the intuitionism and dualism implicit in
Kant’s thought. Hegel’s ‘Phenomenology of Spirit’ was published in 1807 and his
‘The Science of Logic’ from 1812–16. This approach was received so well by
contemporaries that Peirce claims, as late as 1891, that the problems of Cartesian Dualism have effectively been solved. Peirce notes, for example, that “the
old dualistic notion of mind and matter, so prominent in Cartesianism, as two
radically different kinds of substance, will hardly find defenders today. Rejecting this, we are driven to some kind of hylopathy, otherwise called monism”
(EP1: 292).
The impact of Hegelian thought on nineteenth century philosophy was, of
course, extensive and has been well documented. The impact of Hegel on Marx
and Engels, for example, need not detain us here. But Hegel’s influence was
not restricted to Europe alone; it also spread to America. In part, this was because some American Hegelians, such as Brokmeyer, were immigrants from
Germany (Goetzmann 1973). In part, it was also due to American philosophers,
such as Royce, travelling to study in Germany. In the 1860’s, the ‘St Louis Philosophical Society’ was founded with the specific aim of spreading the influence
of Hegelian thought. To this purpose, it launched the ‘Journal of Speculative
Philosophy’ which became “the most important philosophical journal in America from 1867 to 1893” (Goetzmann 1973: 8). This was a journal to which Peirce
made contributions in the early part of his career (e.g., EP1: 11; EP1: 28; EP1:

4

Introduction: Hegel, Peirce, and Vygotsky

56). In later years, the influence of Hegelianism also spread across several
American universities. As John Kaag (2011: 557) notes, “Hegel’s followers invaded Harvard and MIT in the 1870’s and 1880’s, a fact that disturbed James by
their total dominance of the philosophical field”, and this picture is supported
by both Bernstein (2013: 105) and Jensen (2004: 271). In the early twentieth century, a Hegelian account of human cognition was revived by Royce, a colleague
of Peirce, who delivered a series of influential ‘Lectures on Modern Idealism’ in
1906 (Royce [1919] 2017).
When reading Peirce, it is important to bear this nineteenth century context
in mind. As will be seen, Peirce often depicts his philosophy as being distinct
from Hegel, but it must be recognised that he was working in an environment
that was already “thick with Hegelisms” (Jensen 2004: 271). As a result, Peirce
sought to emphasise his points of difference from Hegel whilst assuming that
his academic audience would probably recognise the underlying convergences
in their thought. This is the philosophical context in which Peirce’s comments
on Hegel should be interpreted.
In the early decades of the twentieth century Hegel’s reputation was seriously
undermined, however, by two events that took place outside of philosophy itself –
the outbreak of the First World War and the rise of Soviet communism in 1918.
The perceived relationship between Hegelian thought and the ideology of the
German state, on the one hand, and the new Soviet regime, on the other, rendered Hegel’s philosophy inimical to academics in both the USA and Britain. At
the close of the war, Royce’s earlier ‘Lectures on Modern Idealism’ (Royce [1919]
2017) were published by Yale University. Even in these early post war years, their
editor, Loewenberg, provides us with a vivid description of the emerging relationship with Hegelian thought (Royce 1919: ix):
We have particular reason to value at this moment a dispassionate estimate of that phase
of philosophy which, like German music, must suffer through the retrospective judgment
of the war. During the present generation it seems difficult to approach without prejudice
the products of German genius. The war may be said to have created a ‘German problem’
[. . .] Unfortunately, the boundary between her war and her philosophy is not easy to define. The treacherous onslaught upon the peace of the world in 1914 was no isolated phenomenon. It was the outcome of a definite theory of life.

Matters were made worse by several other factors. In America, Peirce had died
in 1914 and Royce in 1916. Their absent voices, which might have provided a
bulwark for Hegelian philosophy, were replaced by philosophers keen to forge
new beginnings. In the decades after 1918 several intellectual traditions emerged
which represented substantial philosophical departures. In 1916, Saussure’s
‘Course in General Linguistics’ was published, initiating the beginnings of structural linguistics. In England, Russell developed his ‘logical atomism’ and his

theory of ‘knowledge by acquaintance’ (Russell [1959] 1985) whilst Ayer, following the Vienna Circle, advocated ‘logical positivism’ (Ayer [1936] 2001). But the
most influential work was that of Wittgenstein, culminating in his ‘Philosophical
Investigations’ (Wittgenstein 2009). This legacy helped initiate both the ‘linguistic turn’ in modern philosophy and the ‘analytic tradition’. These perspectives
formed new approaches to meaning making which were highly antithetical to the
nineteenth century traditions of Hegel and Peirce.
But history had not yet finished with Hegel’s legacy. The growing threat of
Soviet communism in the 1930’s, and the rise of fascism in the inter-war years,
created further reasons to reject his thought. After the Second World War, and
with the advent of the Cold War, the reputation of Hegel was arguably at its lowest point. One has only to read Popper to grasp the depths to which Hegelian philosophy had plumbed. Popper asserted, for example, in ‘The Open Society and its
Enemies’, that “I have tried to show the identity of Hegelian historicism with the
philosophy of modern totalitarianism” (Popper 1945: 78).
In the second half of the twentieth century Hegelian thought was largely in
hibernation – at least in the Anglo-Saxon world. Bernstein (2013: 111) notes, for
example, that “it was completely moribund – and this is just the way that most
philosophers in America thought it should be”. One additional factor was, of
course, McCarthyism which encouraged an intellectual environment which effectively “eliminated views like Hegel’s” (McCumber 1996: 46). Despite this,
however, in the post-war period, Sellars was able to publish his influential ‘Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind’. In this work, he attacked the ‘Myth of the
Given’ and Sellars openly acknowledged that his views reflected “incipient
Meditations Hegeliènnes” (Sellars 1997: 45). However, it was not until the late
twentieth century that interest in Hegel began to revive in any significant form
with the work of John McDowell (1994) and Robert Brandom (2000). As such, it
is only in recent decades that Hegel’s philosophical reputation has begun to be
revised.
The trajectory of Hegelian thought across the last two hundred years,
briefly summarised above, is relevant to this essay because it helps contextualise the ways in which modern semioticians have read Peirce. Separated from
the Hegelian context which once enveloped his thought, Peirce’s semiotics can
be perceived from a strictly twentieth century perspective. His philosophical
references, and the terminology which he uses, thus become distanced from
the modern reader. And this effect has also had an impact on our understanding of Vygotsky who has been often viewed through the same distorting lens.
Modern perspectives on Vygotsky have, for example, emphasised his potential
links to social constructivism and have diminished the highly significant influences of Hegel.

Introduction: Hegel, Peirce, and Vygotsky

Hegel and Peirce
One of the most comprehensive discussions of the relationship between Hegel
and Peirce is that conducted by Robert Stern. His ‘Hegelian Metaphysics’ (Stern
2009: 209–326) discusses, over one hundred pages, how Peircean thought was
influenced by Hegel. He considers the connections between the two philosophers at four levels; Peirce’s pragmatism, a discussion of whether Hegel is a
nominalist or a realist, and Peirce’s concepts of secondness and firstness. Although there are some points of divergence between Hegel and Peirce, Stern
concludes that “in the final analysis, then, Peirce and Hegel can be brought
closer together than may at first have appeared; and on reflection this is not so
surprising” (Stern 2009: 326). The differences which exist between Hegel and
Peirce will be evaluated later, but it is significant that Stern’s conclusion reflects the central thrust of this essay.
What is remarkable, however, is the way in which Stern’s discussion is still
relatively restricted in its scope. In what is a wide-ranging analysis, there is
scarcely any mention of Peirce’s sign system. There is no discussion of icons, or
symbols, and only a passing reference to his notion of indexicality (Stern 2009:
295–297). This provides an example of how many philosophers view Peirce’s
philosophy. Whilst being willing to engage with his theories of cognition, they
seem reluctant to view Peirce’s semiotics as playing a part in his epistemology.
In Karl-Otto Apel’s work on Peirce (Apel: 1981) a similar pattern can be found.
His book focuses on Kant’s influence on Peirce and so Hegel is inevitably
drawn into his discussion. But like Stern, his analysis is primarily concerned
with Peirce’s categories, and his pragmatism, and he only touches on Peirce’s
sign system (Apel 1981: 99–109).
Stern also notes the relative scarcity of academic interest in the relationship
between Hegel and Peirce and he highlights that the “connection between the
two has received hardly any critical attention” (Stern 2009: 269). He finds only
four journal articles and an unpublished PhD dissertation that deal with their
potential relationship. Given that Hegel and Peirce are some of the most important thinkers in the nineteenth century, this represents an interesting vacuum
in the literature. In 1986, Max Fisch wrote a short article suggesting that much
more work could be carried out in this area and he asserts that, of the influences on Peirce, “pre-eminent among these was Hegel’s” (Fisch 1986b: 264). Significantly, however, Fisch also notes that Peirce was concerned to distance
himself from Hegel and that, “we may put a more charitable construction on
his many overemphatic criticisms of Hegel, which might otherwise strike us as
hostile or arrogant” (Fisch 1986b: 274–275).

In one of the articles mentioned by Stern, Shapiro also agrees that there are
significant convergences between Hegel and Peirce, and he claims that “in fact,
Hegel’s conception of method is much like the one which Peirce uses to best
advantage” (Shapiro 1981: 274). Moreover, he argues that “among the aspects
of Hegel’s system which Peirce explicitly found congenial are evolutionism, the
denial of an unknowable thing-in-itself, a recognition of the principle of continuity, objective idealism and the triadic structure” (Shapiro 1981: 269).
Another commentator that Stern highlights is Jensen. The latter also agrees
that there are important similarities between Hegel and Peirce, but he mistakenly concludes that this convergence was determined by Peirce’s desire to appeal to a Hegelian audience. He states that “Peirce’s references to Hegel are
primarily, I conclude, intended to make his own thought more accessible to his
would-be auditors; in short, Peirce was trying to establish a connection ‘with
things already in the air’” (Jensen 2004: 283). Elsewhere, Townsend also concludes that “there is a fundamental and significant resemblance between the
logic of Peirce and that of Hegel” (Townsend 1928: 303), but he proposes that
these convergences were, in fact, the outcome of similarities between Peirce
and Royce.
In contrast to the very few commentators who note the similarities between
Peirce and Hegel, there are others who focus on their philosophical differences
and Peirce’s occasional attempts to distance himself from Hegel. It is certainly
true that there is evidence, in Peirce’s work, of his rejection of Hegel. As Nagl
observes (2014: 431), quoting Rockmore (1999: 179), some of these divergences
are highlighted by writers who, as modern pragmatists, are reticent about the
Hegelian origins of their own philosophical tradition. But, as argued above,
Peirce’s comments should also be read in the intellectual context in which he
was writing. When he highlights his own position contra Hegel, he is often able
to assume that any deeper convergences between their thought would be recognised by his audience. Indeed, Peirce’s occasional use of German terminology,
such as Bestimmen and aufheben indicate that he, and his readers, were familiar with the central concepts of German Idealism. Perhaps his indebtedness to
Hegel emerges more clearly when Peirce frames it in a more oblique manner.
On one occasion, for example, Peirce states that, in contrast to contemporary
American and English institutions “the German universities have been the light
of the whole world” (EP2: 47).
In the context of the potential connections between Peirce and Hegel, it is
also useful to set to one side those potential links which commentators have
also identified between Hegel and Saussurean semiology. A primary advocate
of these connections has been Derrida (1982) who highlights that Hegel, in his
‘Philosophy of Mind’, makes a critical distinction between ‘symbols’ (which

8

Introduction: Hegel, Peirce, and Vygotsky

have an analogous connection with what they connote) and ‘signs’ which form
an arbitrary link (Hegel: [1830] 1894: 458)
The sign is different from the symbol: for in the symbol the original characters (in essence
and conception) of the visible object are more or less identical with the import which it
bears as symbol; wherein the sign, strictly so-called, the natural attributes of the intuition, and the connotation of which it is a sign, have nothing to do with one another.

On this basis, Derrida suggests that Hegel drew an early distinction between
Saussurean signifiers and signifieds. Modern commentators (Salter: 1992; Burns:
2000), however, argue that Derrida overstates his case, whilst accepting that
there is some truth in his claims. For example, Salter confirms his “belief in the
potency of Hegelian semiotics” (Salter 1992: 176) and Burns concludes that “we
are in fundamental agreement with Derrida that the influence of Hegel’s philosophy generally, and of Hegel’s theory of the sign in particular, on Saussure’s
Course in General Linguistics is great indeed” (Burns 2000: 19). Elsewhere, Wood
argues that, for Hegel, signs operate in “the realm of what Hegel calls Objective
Spirit, so called because it contains the institutions and practices, originating in
individual subjectivity, that live on in objectivity by being passed on to others
through the use of signs in linguistic mediation” (Wood 2008: 615). In other
words, Hegelian signs operate within a context of culture and language.
But these potential connections between Hegel and the semiology of Saussure need to be placed in their full context. Critically, Hegel’s discussion of
symbols and signs falls within his broader discussion of language. As such, it is
not surprising that links to modern linguistics are found by Derrida and, indeed, by other commentators. But what should be emphasised is that Hegel’s
analysis of language is quite distinct from his dialectical approach to cognition
which is discussed in this essay. This separation is important. It will be argued
that Peircean semiotics is firmly rooted in Hegelian thought and that these origins can be found in his dialectical account of concept formation. But this
claim is quite different to that of Derrida regarding the origins of modern linguistics. This essay does, as a result, agree that Hegel is a semiotician avant la
lettre, but not in the way that is proposed by Derrida. Whilst Saussure is primarily concerned with linguistics and culture, Peirce, instead, is focused on the
epistemological aspects of Hegel’s philosophy and how these underpin a semiotic theory of knowledge which explains the empirical world.
Overall, however, in summarising the relationship between Hegel and
Peirce, the most striking observation remains the fact that modern philosophers
seldom include Peirce’s theory of signs in their discussions. This is the case
with Stern, but it is also characteristic of other commentators. Peirce’s semiotics
seem to be isolated from his wider philosophy by a twentieth century division

Hegel and Vygotsky; Peirce and Vygotsky

that wishes to impose a separation between semiotics (and its cultural overtones) and epistemological philosophy. It can be concluded, as a result, that
there are two main issues which need to be considered when comparing Hegel
and Peirce. Firstly, there are, surprisingly, very few such comparisons. Secondly, what has been written is primarily focused on Peirce’s categories, his
logic, and the extent to which he distinguishes his own thought from that of
Hegel. These factors mean that Peirce’s own epistemology often becomes isolated from his semiotics. An aim of this essay is to demonstrate that this separation is mistaken; Peirce’s semiotics is part of, and fundamentally stems from,
his account of cognition which, in turn, is Hegelian in nature.

Hegel and Vygotsky; Peirce and Vygotsky
The influence of Hegel on Vygotsky is far better documented. This is largely because Vygotsky openly acknowledges his debt to Hegel and does not seek to
create distance from him. Despite this, however, the treatment of Vygotsky’s relationship with Hegel is still often marginalised by modern commentators.
This, as will be highlighted, is largely the result of twentieth century attempts
to recruit Vygotsky into the social constructivist fold. As a result, the secondary
literature often notes that Vygotsky was influenced by Hegel but does not bring
this critical aspect to the fore.
Van Der Veer and Valsiner’s ‘Understanding Vygotsky: A Quest for Synthesis’
(1991) provides a good example of how the connection between Hegel and Vygotsky is often framed. They acknowledge that these connections exist; they
highlight that Vygotsky read Hegel in his youth, that Hegel’s dialecticism impacted upon him (Van der Veer and Valsiner 1991: 322), and that Hegel’s notion
of ‘sublation’ is present in Vygotsky’s work (Van der Veer and Valsiner 1991:
278). But the Hegelian impact on Vygotsky’s dialectical psychology is seldom
placed centre stage. Hegel is seen as one of many influences on Vygotsky,
rather than the philosopher who primarily helped frame his thought.
Bakhurst picks up on Vygotsky’s debt to Hegel. He states that he is convinced that Vygotsky “should be seen against a philosophical tradition [of]
‘high rationalism’’’ (Bakhurst 2007: 58) and he naturally includes Hegel within
this. But he also acknowledges that “many of Vygotsky’s contemporary followers will be sceptical. They will grant that an appreciation of Vygotsky’s favourite philosophers is sometimes relevant to understanding his ideas, just as
it is also important to know something about the many psychologists he discusses. But it would be a mistake, they will argue, to emphasize the rationalist
tenor of Vygotsky’s thought” (Bakhurst 2007: 59). Amongst such sceptics could

10

Introduction: Hegel, Peirce, and Vygotsky

be included Wertsch who, in the same volume (Wertsch 2007: 178–192), evaluates the idea of ‘mediation’ without mention of Hegel. Instead, he views this
key concept in Vygotskian thought as being either social, or linguistic, or based
on “natural language” (Wertsch 2007: 181). Elsewhere, Daniels, notes that “Vygotsky most definitely adopted a dialectical world view” (Daniels 2016: 36), but
Daniels still insists that Vygotskian meaning is socially created rather than dialectically formed.
Some commentators, however, do insist that Hegel has a greater role in Vygotsky’s philosophy. Blunden (2017 132–145), for example, provides a detailed account of the similarities between Vygotsky and Hegel and includes a useful
discussion of Hegel’s ‘The Science of Logic’. He also highlights, quite rightly, the
debt that Vygotsky owes to Hegel in terms of his ‘units of analysis’ (‘word meanings’). Elsewhere, Blunden also discusses the notion of ‘gestalt’ and argues that
Vygotsky is influenced by Goethe who, in turn, had a major impact on Hegel. As
such, he suggests that Vygotsky was influenced by this intellectual tradition from
both sources (Blunden 2011: 457–471). Kozulin (1990: 118–121) also discusses the
“problem of mediation” in Vygotsky and links this notion back to Hegel.
However, a more sustained analysis of Hegel’s influence on Vygotsky is
provided by Jan Derry. She not only situates Vygotskian thought within a Hegelian context, but places this within a wider Spinozist framework. Derry correctly
insists that Hegel represents “the most significant philosopher for Vygotsky”
(Derry 2013: 105) and she discusses the relationship between Spinoza, Hegel,
and Vygotsky. Importantly, she highlights that none of these philosophers accept a ‘correspondence theory’ of truth and she states that “for Vygotsky, a concept does not correspond to an object but enables thinking by including the
object ‘in a complex system of mediating connections and relations disclosed in
determinations of the concept’” (Derry 2013: 129). This is a critical proposition
that, as we will see, also echoes Peirce. It contains the important assertion that
thought determinations define the nature of objects and that these, in turn,
form mediating entities. This is one of the most important areas of convergence
between Peirce, Hegel, and Vygotsky. Derry successfully identifies two of this
triumvirate, but Peirce, unfortunately, does not feature in her discussion.
Derry’s treatment of Vygotsky is also limited in other respects. It is mainly
concerned with a defence of Vygotsky against the charge, made by Wertsch,
that the latter’s work represents a form of “decontextualised rationality” (Derry
2013: 6). Derry makes a strong case in favour of Vygotsky and demonstrates
that his rationality is, in fact, embedded in the mind’s construction of objects.
But one effect of this is to draw her away from a wider discussion of Hegel’s dialectics. Moreover, Derry’s treatment of semiotics also reflects the constructivist
approaches of Halliday and Kress, (Derry 2013: 41) and this deflects her from

The ‘natural history of the sign’

11

Peircean sign theory. However, in many ways, Derry’s work remains philosophically close to the current discussion.
Given the above discussion, it is unsurprising that there is also scant analysis
of any potential influence of Peirce on Vygotsky. Any which may have existed is
almost certainly the result of Vygotsky’s interest in the American pragmatism. In
an article entitled ‘An Interesting Resemblance: Vygotsky, Mead and American
Pragmatism’, Edwards (2007: 77–100), highlights the similarities between Vygotsky and Mead, but she concludes that “there is no indication that Vygotsky was
influenced directly by Peirce’s system of semiotics”. Hans-Johann Glock (1986:
131–148) also suggests that Vygotsky and Mead adopt similar approaches, but
he does not explore how such convergences might be rooted in their Hegelian
heritage.
Overall, the secondary commentary on Hegel, Peirce, and Vygotsky reveals,
therefore, relatively little focus on the inter-relationships which exist between
them. There are several factors at play here, but it is evident that the main issue
is the frequent reluctance of contemporary semioticians to recognise Hegel’s influence on their discipline. Moreover, those few philosophers who have sought
to compare Peirce with Hegel have made little attempt to evaluate the potential
connections which may exist within Peirce’s sign theory. Instead, these commentators have focused on other aspects of Peirce’s philosophy – feeling, no
doubt, that semiotics falls outside of their remit.
There are, however, other factors at work. One of these is the way Peirce
uses the term ‘sign’ and his reluctance to use the word ‘concept’. This makes it
quite difficult for commentators to identify the underlying connections between
Peirce’s sign theory and Hegelian concept formation. This issue will now be
considered in some detail. It forms yet another barrier preventing the relationship between the two philosophers being understood.

The ‘natural history of the sign’
One of the reasons why it is relatively simple to make a philosophical connection
between Hegel and Vygotsky is that both thinkers are openly concerned with
concept formation. One of the difficulties with Peirce, however, is that this aspect
of his work is often obscured by the terminology he adopts. Critically, he uses a

12

Introduction: Hegel, Peirce, and Vygotsky

language of ‘signs’ rather than that of concepts.1 This makes his understanding
of how concepts are formed quite difficult to follow for the modern reader. And
this problem is exacerbated by the fact that modern semioticians tend to view
‘signs’ as experiential manifestations (e.g., culturally formed words, images etc)
which are given meaning via interpretation. Within this framework, signs are
predominantly construed as external experiential vehicles which are given internal meanings. Nöth (1995: 79), for example, notes that this is how signs are generally viewed when he notes that “in this handbook, the concept of sign is
generally used in its broadest sense of a natural or conventional semiotic entity
consisting of a sign vehicle connected with meaning”.
These difficulties create significant barriers to understanding the intent of
Peirce’s semiotics. One of the main arguments of this essay is that Peirce, following Hegel, seeks to establish an account of concept formation. Simultaneously, however, he also wants to distance himself from Hegel’s dialectical
solution by insisting that this activity is a matter of sign formation. As a result,
he uses the terminology of signs, and their combination, rather than the language of concepts and dialecticism. Indeed, this can be observed in his classification of signs: the term ‘sign’ has an extremely broad meaning for Peirce.
‘Qualisigns’ are, for example, defined as ‘vague’ perceptions, whilst ‘propositions’, and ‘arguments’ are also classified as sign types (EP2: 292). And Peirce
also argues that signs encompass all human thought when he asserts that “we
think only in signs” (CP2: 397) and that “now thought is of the nature of a sign”
(EP2: 380). For Peirce, therefore, signs are much more than experiential inputs
given meaning by the mind; they are the very building blocks of thought itself.
It is a mistake, therefore, to assume that Peirce is using the word ‘sign’ in a
manner that is common in twentieth century semiology. In contrast, Peirce is
following Hegel. He seeks to explain how human concepts are formed and he
uses the terminology of signs in this endeavour. Peirce makes his own position
clear when he states that signs are fundamental to the “embodiment of thought”
(EP2: 256):

1 Despite Peirce’s infrequent use of the term ‘concept’ it is significant that the first line of his
first major paper (On a New List of Categories) opens with a sentence that states: “This paper is
based upon the theory already established, that the function of conceptions is to reduce the
manifold of sensuous impressions to unity, and that the validity of a conception consists in
the impossibility of reducing the content of consciousness to unity without the introduction of
it.” (EP1: 1). This statement places Peirce’s semiotic project firmly in the tradition of Kant and
German Idealism.

The ‘natural history of the sign’

13

For since thought has no being except in so far as it will be embodied, and since the embodiment of thought is a sign, the business of logical critic cannot be undertaken until the
whole structure of signs, especially of general signs, has been thoroughly investigated.

This perspective is a central feature of Peirce’s semiotics. He believes that signs
are how human thoughts are ‘embodied’. They are not, therefore, experiential
entities which are first observed and then interpreted. Instead, Peirce makes
the much stronger claim that human thoughts are structured through signs;
they are how the mind thinks; they determine the very forms of thought.
Peirce’s position on the nature of signs can be elucidated in diagrammatical
terms. In Figure 1, four distinct processes involving signs can be identified.
They occur along two reflexive dimensions (A and B). The first dimension (A)
involves the development of concepts from raw perceptions. In the medieval
period, and for Hegel, this aspect of concept development was described as
‘speculative’ in nature (Deely 2009: 72). For Peirce, this dimension describes
the formation of signs, and it forms the basis of his ‘speculative grammar’
which he describes as “an analysis of what kinds of signs are absolutely essential to the embodiment of thought” (EP2: 257). Critically, in this first dimension,
concepts also have the reflexive ability to act as perceptual tools through which
the world is experienced as signs.2 This is a departure from empiricist accounts
which maintain that concepts are positioned as the outcomes (rather than the
determinants) of human experience.
In the second dimension (B), there is also a two-way process at work. Concepts formed in the first ‘speculative’ stage are now used in human communication and are employed, as symbols, in the construction of propositions. Peirce
describes this second dimension as “speculative rhetoric”, or the “art of putting

2 Deely highlights the reflexive stage in the first dimension of Figure 1 as something which
differentiates humans from animals. He argues that “the second mode which distinguishes intellectus from animal perception as such is the effect that it has upon perception when it returns to the order of what is sense-perceptible in order to affect that order in line with the
animal nature of the one conceiving. In other words, the second mode of intellectus is that
whereby it returns to its origins in phantasiari in order to serve the arrangement of objects
proper to phantasiari to accord with the needs and desires of the human organism, the human
animal, the human person. The Latins called this mode of intellectus ‘practical’ and recognised
its status as derivative from the awareness distinctive of human understanding in the formula
‘speculative understanding becomes practical by extension’” (Deely 2009: 72–73). The medievals, therefore, believed that concepts, developed in the ‘speculative’ stage, are employed in
subsequent perceptual activity. This is the framework which Hegel, Peirce, and Vygotsky also
adopt. They maintain that the world is also perceived through human concepts and this, of
course, is another reason why the terminology of concepts and signs becomes so often
conflated.

propositions into effective forms” (EP2: 19). But along this dimension, there is
also another reflexive aspect. The signs which are used in such communication
naturally evoke new concepts in others; dimension (B) thus has an interpersonal
aspect to it. In Saussure’s semiology, his focus is placed on this second dimension when he analyses how meanings are formed in a culture. Hegel, Peirce, and
Vygotsky, however, differ in their approach. Their central concern is with the
‘speculative’ dimension (A) where concepts are first established. It is in this context that Peirce insists that (EP2: 257):
Speculative Grammar ought not to confine its studies to those conventional signs of
which language is composed, but that it will do well to widen its field of view so as to
take into consideration also kinds of signs which, not being conventional, are not of the
nature of language.

A central claim of this essay is that Peirce’s focus on ‘speculative grammar’
should be more fully recognised; it involves the semiotic formation of the
mind’s conceptual apparatus. This process is called, by Vygotsky, the ‘natural
history of the sign’ (Vygotsky 1978: 45). It takes place, as will be seen, within
Peirce’s first and second trichotomies and, specifically, through the combination of his icons, indices, and symbols. These sign types frame the human intellect’s subsequent thoughts about the world; they act as ‘tools’ to understand it.
Of course, Peirce also discusses, within his third trichotomy, the nature of
human communication and how symbols can be used to form propositions, but
this second part of his semiotics is always founded on the prior activity of concept formation. As such, signs are not simply experiential ‘vehicles’ awaiting
interpretation; they are how the human mind develops its concepts and structures its very thoughts.
Importantly, Hegel also proposes a similar ‘speculative’ framework. He rejects the view that human concepts are formed through ‘interpretation’ and
he attacks the conventional view that they are “mere forms of thought”. In

The ‘natural history of the sign’

15

contrast, Hegel suggests ([1892] 2014: 187–188) a very different view of concept formation in which human concepts possess “a character of thorough
concreteness”:
In the logic of understanding the notion is generally reckoned a mere form of thought, and
treated as a general conception. It is to this inferior view of the notion that the assertion
refers . . . that notions as such are something dead, empty, and abstract. The case is really
quite the reverse. The notion is, on the contrary, the principle of all life, and thus possesses
at the same time a character of thorough concreteness . . . . And yet, as it was before remarked, the notion is a true concrete; for the reason that it involves Being and Essence,
and the total wealth of these two spheres with them, merged in the unity of thought.

In the following chapters, it will be suggested that Peircean semiotics can be
usefully construed within this Hegelian framework. Peircean signs are created
by the mind, they enable us to form concepts, and they determine the nature of
“concrete” reality.
A critic of this position will ask whether such a claim is supported by Peirce’s own words. Does Peirce, at any point, agree that Hegel influences his semiotic theory? Peirce is, of course, always keen to insist that he reaches his own
philosophical conclusions independently of Hegel, but he acknowledges that
(EP2: 143–144):
In regard to these, it appears to me that Hegel is so nearly right that my own doctrine
might very well be taken for a variety of Hegelianism, although in point of fact it was determined in my mind by considerations entirely foreign to Hegel, at a time when my attitude toward Hegelianism was one of contempt. There was no influence upon me from
Hegel unless it was of so occult a kind as to entirely escape my ken; and if there was such
an occult influence, it strikes me as about as good an argument for the essential truth of
the doctrine, as is the coincidence that Hegel and I arrived in quite independent ways
substantially to the same result.

Leaving aside Peirce’s natural desire to compare himself with Hegel, and his
reluctance to acknowledge his influence, Peirce clearly accepts that similarities
do exist between their two philosophies. As has been highlighted, Peirce was
surrounded by Hegelian thinking and it is probable that such “occult” activity
may well have occurred. Elsewhere, Peirce also acknowledges that “when
Hegel tells me that thought has three stages, that of naïve acceptance, that of
reaction and criticism, and that of rational conviction; in a general sense, I
agree to it” (EP1: 237). And he also agrees that “my thought resuscitates Hegel,
though in stage costume” (CP1: 42). However, more convincing evidence that
Peirce’s semiotic project has its roots within Hegelian thought can be found in
the following passage. Discussing Hegel’s “objective logic” – Hegel’s term for
the speculative stage of concept formation – Peirce states (CP2: 111) that:

16

Introduction: Hegel, Peirce, and Vygotsky

But now we have to examine whether there be a doctrine of signs corresponding to Hegel’s objective logic; that is to say, whether there be a life in Signs, so that – the requisite
vehicle being present – they will go through a certain order of development, and if so,
whether this development be merely of such a nature that the same round of changes of
form is described over and over again whatever be the matter of the thought, or whether,
in addition to such a repetitive order, there be also a greater life-history that every symbol
furnished with a vehicle of life goes through, and what is the nature of it.

Here, Peirce asserts that a symbol requires to be “furnished with a vehicle of
life” – an entity that allows it to grow.3 And he asks if there is “a life in signs”
which represents the evolution of a sign culminating in a symbol. This Hegelian
manner of thinking is also evident in one of Peirce’s earliest works, the ‘On a New
List of Categories’. Written in 1868, this paper explicitly positions the sign, using
terminology which echoes Hegel, as a mediating pathway between ‘Being’ and
‘Substance’ (EP1: 6):
BEING,
Quality (Reference to a Ground),
Relation (Reference to a Correlate),
Representation (Reference to an Interpretant),
SUBSTANCE

Here, Peirce frames the sign as a mechanism enabling the human mind to move
from the indeterminacy of ‘Being’ to the synthetic knowledge of ‘Substance’.
This is an important aspect of Peircean sign theory which will be discussed
later.
It has been noted that Vygotsky also claims that concept formation involves
signs. As noted above, he talks of “the natural history of the sign” (Vygotsky
1978: 45) and he maintains that this forms the activity of concept development.
Echoing Hegel and Peirce before him, Vygotsky explains how the human mind
moves from its raw perceptions (“natural perceptions”) to the concepts of the
“higher psychological processes”. In doing so, Vygotsky also adopts the Hegelian notion of conceptual evolution. As will be highlighted in due course, Vygotsky’s “natural history” differs from Hegel and Peirce because he is less
concerned with epistemological issues. But it is also clear that he shares their
underlying framework.

3 Beverley Kent in a short article (Kent 1977: 142–146) claims, when referring to this passage
on ‘objective logic’, that she cannot find any subsequent reference to it in any of the classification schemes advanced by Peirce (Kent 1977: 145). I would suggest, however, that Peirce’s ‘objective logic’ is the very process in his classification of signs through which signs combine
with each other.

The ‘natural history of the sign’

17

Of course, the belief that signs ‘evolve’ is well documented in the secondary
literature (Nöth 2020: 182–191). Semioticians often refer to this process as ‘semiosis’. But this activity is often construed in a particular manner: as a continuous
action involving the interpretation and re-interpretation of signs. Eco, for example, talks of semiosis as follows: “at least since the Hellenistic period, we mean
by semiotics the study of the phenomenon of semiosis, that is to say, the process through which humans emit and interpret signs” (Eco 2018: 344), whilst
Hoffmeyer defines semiosis as “the process by which signs are exchanged”
(Hoffmeyer 1996: 18). But these more modern views obscure, however, Peirce’s
deeper intent. He wants to understand how the sign itself evolves (as a concept)
which can be used to understand the empirical world. In this respect, Peirce
himself defines semiosis as an activity that takes place within the sign (EP2:
411):
But by ‘semiosis’ I mean, on the contrary, an action, or influence, which is, or involves, a
cooperation of three subjects, such as a sign, its object, and its interpretant, this trirelative influence not being in any way resolvable into actions between pairs.

These developing triadic relationships amount to more than an exchange of
signs between individuals, or their on-going interpretation within a particular
culture. Certainly, Peirce does conceive of semiosis as a continuous process,
but his sign development involves more than the transmission (and interpretation) of signs in the second dimension of Figure 1. Semiosis, he argues, occurs
as concepts are formed in the dimension he terms ‘speculative grammar’.
At this point, however, it is important to step back one stage in our discussion. If an understanding of Hegel’s influence on Peirce is to be clearly elucidated, it is essential to understand how Hegel’s model of concept formation
differs from modern accounts of this process. Such an analysis will reveal the
connections that exist between Hegel and Peirce and will show how Hegel’s
own account differs radically from that of the twentieth century.
As will be discussed in the next chapter, the model of cognition that dominates much of modern culture construes concept formation as a process that
primarily involves acts of ‘interpretation’. And, critically, it will be shown how
this perspective has filtered into much of twentieth century semiotics. Paradoxically, it is this modern cognitive model that has established the intellectual barriers which exist between parts of contemporary semiotics and the discipline
which Peirce was the first to conceive.

Part One: Perception and the model of ‘secondary
dualism’

1 The model of ‘secondary dualism’
Semiotics is evidently concerned with how meaning is created. This can take
place at either the social or individual level. The activity of meaning making is
often separated, at least in the case of continental semiology, from the processes
that are involved in the activity of perception. Semioticians, such as Saussure
and Barthes, seldom explore this perceptual dimension because their primary
concern is understanding how meaning is determined at a cultural level.
Peirce, however, differs in his approach; he sees his semiotics as both overlapping with, and extending, his account of perception and he is centrally concerned with the philosophical consequences of his account of this activity. As
such, his semiotics is more epistemological in tone. Unsurprisingly, this creates
certain barriers between his own work and that of twentieth century semioticians. At the heart of these divisions is the fact that Peirce advocates a different
model of perception. In this context, it is important to identify what is meant by
a ‘model of perception’ and how such models may impact on a semiotic theory
of meaning making.
Several models of perception will be encountered in the course of this
essay. These include the framework first advocated by Aristotle (which strongly
influenced the premodern period), the model espoused by Hegel, Peirce, and
Vygotsky, and those proposed by modern philosophers such as Merleau-Ponty
(2012) and Noë (2004). These models of perception often have overlapping features, and some, indeed, borrow elements from previous models. For example,
both Hegel and Peirce use aspects of the Aristotelian framework. But what is
also clear is that none of these perceptual models, in themselves, are neutral in
character. They bring, in their theoretical wake, differing accounts of how
human perceptions are formed, what kind of entity ‘exists’ in a perceptual act,
and how human perceptions relate to other parts of each cognitive model (e.g.,
the intellect). Moreover, each model has its own view on the balance of ‘active’
and ‘passive’ elements involved in perception. For example, they disagree on
the extent to which perceptual acts are carried out by an active mind and how
much they involve the world acting upon the passive mind. Additionally, the
critical division between perception and concept formation is often placed in
different locations by each model and this influences their respective accounts
of meaning making. And these differences lead, in turn, to the question of
whether meaning is formed purely by the mind, whether it already exists within
perceptual content itself, or whether meaning is, in fact, created through the
interaction of the mind with its empirical experiences.

22

1 The model of ‘secondary dualism’

This essay mainly focusses on two models of perception. The first of these
emerged in the late seventeenth century and formed the foundations of British
empiricism. It is associated with a cognitive framework in which the human
mind inspects its sense data, in an atomised form, and this leads to the sceptical positions advocated by Hume. The second model evolved in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in response to the perceived failings of
this empiricist template. It was initiated by Kant but was developed by German
Idealism and it reached its apogee with Hegel. This second model is associated
with a different terminology – that of indeterminacy, dialecticism, mediation,
and the belief that both perception and reality are intrinsically relational. This
is the model which influenced both Peirce and Vygotsky. They both recognised
the flaws in the empiricist model which had been identified by German Idealism and this informed their own work. In the case of Peirce, his rejection of the
empiricist template led to the development of his semiotic theory. With Vygotsky, his critique of the same empiricist position led to his rejection of the associationist accounts of child psychology which were dominant in his day.
This chapter begins with the model of perception proposed by the British empiricist tradition. It represents an essential background for our understanding of
Hegel and Peirce. This model offers, at first glance, what seems to be a commonsensical approach to cognition. It makes a clear distinction between what the mind
experiences and how the intellect subsequently thinks about those experiences.
But this binary division determines a particular way of thinking about perception. It creates a framework which is inherently dualistic and, as a result, it leads
to certain philosophical implications which will be evaluated during this chapter.
The division of the mind that this model creates has significant effects in terms of
how perception, and meaning making, are subsequently construed. It is a framework that will be called, for the purposes of this essay, ‘secondary dualism’.
But why should we call this model ‘secondary dualism’? It merits this term
because it represents a form of dualism which exists exclusively inside the
mind. It is, therefore, a division which is quite distinct from the more familiar
form of dualism which Descartes (1641/1985) initiated between the mind (‘res
cogitans’) and the world (‘res extensa’). This Cartesian form of dualism separates human perceptions from the external world and leads to the view that
there is an unbridgeable gap between what Kant later called ‘phenomenal’ experience and the ‘noumenal’ world behind it. But ‘secondary dualism’ is quite
different from this. It is a new, and arguably derivative, form of dualism which
separates the internal representations of the world in the mind from its thoughts
about those perceptions. Paradoxically, ‘secondary dualism’ has often been proposed by philosophers as a potential way to avoid the more damaging effects of
‘primary dualism’. It seems, after all, to afford a certain kind of knowledge about

1.1 The ‘mirror of nature’

23

the contents of the human mind. It is claimed, for example, that if knowledge of
the noumenal world cannot be established, then, perhaps, some knowledge of
our sense impressions themselves is achievable. This, they argue, might be a way
to avoid the problems that Descartes has created for philosophy and create a
foundation for human knowledge. But leaving this question aside for the time
being, it is clear that ‘secondary dualism’ establishes a new form of dualism and
that it is one that is positioned within the mind.
It must be noted, of course, that Peirce never uses the term ‘secondary dualism’ himself. But his critique of this model of cognition is often the driving force
behind his semiotic theory. Peirce often describes his own critique of the conventional model of perception as an attack on ‘nominalism’, but the term ‘secondary
dualism’ is, in some ways, more appropriate for his target. The latter is much
broader in its scope, and it is also more specific in identifying the central weakness of nominalism. As a term, nominalism tends to limit the scope of its philosophical effects to the specific issue of giving identities to objects. But ‘secondary
dualism’, whilst encompassing this problem, also addresses the more extensive
ramifications of modern philosophy’s desire to divide the mind in two.

1.1 The ‘mirror of nature’
‘Secondary dualism’ construes the human mind as a mental ‘arena’. On the one
side of this internal mental ‘space’ are the perceptions (or sense data) that the
mind ‘receives’ from the ‘external’ world. These are often described as ‘representations’ of external reality and are ‘viewed’ by the mind, on the other side of
this internal dualism, as if they were reflected in a ‘mirror’. This analogy in captured by Richard Rorty in his book called ‘Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature’,
and it is also why he construes the mind as being like a “glassy essence” (Rorty
1980: 42).4 In this model, our cognitive activities are thus construed as if they
are a metaphorical “inner eye” (Rorty 1980: 45) which inspects its sense data.
Since the seventeenth century, this model has come to dominate the way in
which modernity construes human cognitive activity. It is important, as a result, to consider some of the assumptions that underpin its model.
Firstly, this model insists that there is a fundamental ‘gap’ between our sense
data and our thoughts about them. This dualism has certain characteristics. The

4 Rorty borrows the notion of ‘glassy essence’ from Isabella’s speech in ‘Measure for Measure’
(Rorty 1980: 42). It is coincidental that Peirce also published a paper using the terminology of
the ‘glassy essence’ in 1892 (EP1: 334–351).

24

1 The model of ‘secondary dualism’

two activities in the mind – images reflecting in the ‘mirror’ of the mind, and the
mind’s interpretations of them – are felt to be of very different kinds. The ‘reflections’ in the ‘mirror’ are perceptual, whilst the thought processes about them are
intellectual. It follows from this that the conceptual and the perceptual are held
distinct from each other and, in addition, it is maintained that the latter always
precedes the former. Moreover, the reception of sense data is often construed as
being passive, whilst the mind is viewed as active. It selects from the sense data
present on the ‘mirror’ and it decides what is important. This immediately builds
an element of subjectivity into the mind’s reflective activities and informs the view
that human knowledge is interpretative. Finally, this model even has an implicit
layout. The intellect is positioned at ‘right angles’ to its mental ‘mirror’. McDowell
describes this way of thinking about human cognition as the “sideways-on picture
of the understanding and the world” (McDowell 1994: 82).
It is clear, therefore, that this cognitive model comes embedded with a set
of assumptions about the intellect and its potential relationship with its sense
data. But this is only the beginning of the story of ‘secondary dualism’. Critically, the model also insists that sense data are experienced in a particular format; they are always experienced as individuated sense impressions rather than
as a continuum. As a result, they can only be perceived by the mind as atomised units. This has two far reaching consequences. Firstly, an individual sense
datum cannot be observed which consists, simultaneously, of two qualities. It
is not possible, for example, to have a sense impression that is both blue and
yellow. If this were to occur, then, of necessity, it would be experienced as two
distinct sense data. It follows from this that sense data are always exhausted by
a single quality. This is one of the main effects of nominalism; the mind’s act of
giving an identity to a particular sense datum demands a separation of it from
other sense data. Secondly, this effect of atomising sense data leads directly to
the conclusion that it is not possible to observe any potential connections which
may exist between sense data; they can only be inferred.
However, another effect of this cognitive model is often viewed in a more
positive light. As noted earlier, some philosophers argue that it is possible, at
least, to have direct access (or ‘direct acquaintance’) with the mind’s sense data.
It is suggested, therefore, that even though access to the noumenal world is impossible, the intellect enjoys knowledge of its sense data qua sense data. For example, I cannot know that a particular external object is ‘red’, but I can be
certain that I have a sense datum that looks ‘red’ to me. This view is accepted by
some philosophers as a foundational basis for human knowledge and it often
leads to phenomenological theories of cognition.
However, when the consequences of this cognitive model are explored, the
outcome is usually one of philosophical scepticism. If potential linkages between

1.1 The ‘mirror of nature’

25

sense data cannot be observed by the mind, then it follows that any connections
which may (or may not) exist in the world cannot be known. This philosophical
problem comes in many guises, but one of the most famous is Hume’s claim that
causation cannot be perceived in the world. For example, if we observe billiard
ball ‘a’ hitting billiard ball ‘b’, Hume asks why we should expect a second ball to
move as a result (Hume 2007: 21). He claims that causation cannot be perceived
and that our beliefs in particular effects are thus based on ‘habit’. But this sceptical conclusion stems from the atomistic model that Hume has adopted. For if it
were possible to observe an act of causation between the movements of ball ‘a’
and ball ‘b’ (a flash of light might appear, for instance, as a new ‘sense impression’ (c)), then a new problem would simply be created. Hume would seek a connection between the movement of ball ‘a’ and the new sense impression ‘c’.
Hume is thus condemned to an infinite regress – searching for putative ‘connections’ that his model of perception will always deny him. The same argument
can also be applied to Hume’s claims about induction (Hume 2007: 18–29). He
argues that ‘necessary connections’ between sense data cannot be observed;
‘constant conjunctions’ are all that can be experienced. But Hume’s ‘problem of
induction’ is based on his same assumption about perception. The atomisation of
sense data, intrinsic in the model of ‘secondary dualism’, results in Hume’s inability to experience linkages in the world.
The model of ‘secondary dualism’, however, also has other critical effects.
Leaving aside the problems of philosophical scepticism, the interpretive mind,
in this cognitive model, is always positioned as being relative to its sense data.
It follows from this that human knowledge of the world must be relative too.
And this has resulted in a series of theoretical positions emerging in the last
two centuries. In particular, the view that the mind can only achieve subjective
knowledge has become widespread in the modern age. Moreover, many theorists have gone still further and raised this subjectivist perspective to a social
level. They have concluded, as a result, that any knowledge possessed by a
group of individuals, or by society, must also be relative. This conclusion leads
to the belief in ‘ideology’ and ‘false consciousness’ which emerged in the nineteenth century. In the twentieth century, this position has developed still further
with the emergence of post-structuralism and post-modernism. Both intellectual
movements assert that human knowledge is separated from reality and that, as a
result, human understanding floats free from the world. Baudrillard, for example, maintains that all that can be experienced are ‘simulacra’ which “bear no relation to any reality” (Baudrillard 1988: 170). Such conclusions derive directly

26

1 The model of ‘secondary dualism’

from the template of ‘secondary dualism’ and its separation of sense data from
each other and from the world.5
The influence of the ‘mirror’ model in the modern world can also be recognised in other ways. For, whilst it underpins the tradition of philosophical scepticism, the model simultaneously provides a theoretical platform for science
itself. How does this happen? Paradoxically, ‘secondary dualism’, by insisting
that the mind’s sense data are no more than isolated data points, establishes a
modus operandi for the physical sciences. Scientists take their observed facts
and, assuming that there are no necessary connections between them, they
seek to establish such connections through experimental ‘constant conjunction’. Using statistical methods, these connections can be elevated to a new
level; they can be described as ‘real’ or ‘objective’, rather than merely incidental. The scientific method thus establishes a hold over the modern imagination
through its ability to overcome the problems created by ‘secondary dualism’.
Through such mechanisms the quantitative sciences establish the ‘laws’ of nature and determine their ‘objective’ constructions of the world. It is a testament to
the ubiquitous power of the secondary dualist model in modern culture that this
cognitive framework, therefore, forms both the basis of the scientific method and
its theoretical twin – philosophical scepticism. These two perspectives are conventionally placed in opposition to each other; in fact, they are rooted in the same
cognitive framework.
It has already been noted that ‘secondary dualism’ encourages the philosophical tradition of phenomenology (Glendinning 2007). This school of thought asserts that, because the mind has direct access to its sense data, it can construct its
world. This, in turn, has developed, in the twentieth century, into beliefs in ‘social
constructivism’ which assert that human concepts and meanings are formed
through collaborative social activity. Rejecting the view that meanings exist in the

5 Latour is particularly keen to point out the problems that arise from the model’s dualism. In
relation to postmodernism, Latour emphasises the disconnects that it leads to (Latour 1993:
64–65):
The postmodern condition has recently sought to juxtapose these three great resources of
the modern critique – nature, society, and discourse – without even trying to connect
them. If they are kept distinct, and if all three are separate from the work of hybridization,
the image of the modern world they give is indeed terrifying: a nature and a technology
that are absolutely sleek; a society made up solely of false consciousness, simulacra and
illusions; a discourse consisting only in meaning effects detached from everything; and
this whole world of appearances keeps afloat other disconnected elements of networks
that can be combined haphazardly by collage from all places and all times. Enough, indeed, to make one contemplate jumping off a cliff.

world, social constructivists argue that they are formed through the social practices in a culture. An example of this view can be found in Berger and Luckmann’s
‘The Social Construction of Reality’ where they argue that “the common objectivations of everyday life are maintained primarily by linguistic signification” (1967:
39–40). In the following decades their contention that reality is ‘constructed’ has
expanded to include an array of other social phenomena. As Hacking notes, there
are now academic works elucidating, for example, the social construction of the
child, the emotions, gender, illness, knowledge, immigrants, and schooling (Hacking 1999: 1). At the heart of these perspectives, however, is the fundamental belief
that human concepts are relative to the world, and they reflect the values and social practices of a culture. Hacking, for example, states that (Hacking 1999: 33):
Constructionists tend to maintain that classifications are not determined by how the
world is but are convenient ways in which to represent it. They maintain that the world
does not come quietly wrapped up in facts. Facts are the consequence of ways in which
we represent the world. The constructionist vision here is splendidly old-fashioned. It is a
species of nominalism.

Hacking notes here, and correctly so, that social constructivism can be traced
back to philosophical nominalism. This tradition has a long history with origins
in the medieval period. The nominalist perspective, however, comes to the fore,
in the seventeenth century, when Locke makes a distinction between ‘real essences’ and ‘nominal essences’. In the absence of an ability to know real essences through direct experience, Locke argues that the human mind must make
do with ‘nominal essences’. The latter, he argues, are formed as the mind observes its sense data. The intellect notices a number of similarities between
atomised particulars and concludes that certain ‘kinds’, or essences, exist.
These, however, are nominal, rather than real, because they are formed by the
inspecting mind.6 As a result, Locke maintains that the mind cannot grasp universals as they might exist in reality. Instead, it can only work with constructed
versions of them. Universals, or general concepts, therefore, fall into the same
theoretical camp as both causation and the inductively established laws of nature; they become constructions of the mind. As Forster states (2011: 5):
Nominalists hold, then, that the choice of a conceptual scheme is determined by knowers’
interests rather than by objective features of the world. For them, talk of truth and falsity is
possible only within a framework of laws and general concepts, and any such framework is

6 There is a critical difference between Locke’s nominal and real essences and Leibniz’s nominal and real definitions. By shifting his emphasis from ‘definitions’ to ‘essences’, Locke renders
the distinction dualistic, and mind dependent. Leibniz, in contrast, insists that ‘nominal definitions’ still remain reflective, at least partially, of reality.

28

justified either because claims made using it can be reduced to claims about individuals or
because it provides a useful tool for anticipating experience. Either way, for nominalists,
laws and general concepts are artefacts of economizing minds to which nothing in reality
literally corresponds.

It is of relevance to our later discussions that this nominalist account of essence
stands in contrast to the cognitive model that preceded it. As Rorty explains
(Rorty 1980: 17–69), the ‘mirror’ model of cognition replaced an earlier Aristotelian account of how essences (and universals) become present in the intellect.
In this earlier model of perception, the human mind grasps the ‘forms’, or ‘essences’, that it encounters in the world. This pre-modern template differs from
the Lockean approach in which the mind observes individual instances of ‘x’,
compares them, and asserts they are like each other. In Locke’s model, a universal ‘x’ is purely a creation of the mind, whilst, in the Aristotelian model, the
essence of ‘x’ exists both in reality and as it is instantiated in the intellect
(Rorty 1980: 45):7
But in Aristotle’s conception intellect is not a mirror inspected by an inner eye. It is both
mirror and eye in one. The retinal image is itself the model for the ‘intellect which becomes all things’, whereas in the Cartesian model, the intellect inspects entities modelled
on retinal images. The substantial forms of frogness and starness get right into the Aristotelian intellect and are there in just the same way they are in the frogs and the stars – not
in the way in which frogs and stars are reflected in mirrors. In Descartes’s conception –
the one which became the basis for ‘modern’ epistemology – it is representations which
are in the mind. The Inner Eye surveys these representations hoping to find some mark
which will testify to their fidelity.

In the model of ‘secondary dualism’ it is also clear that a particular order effect is
at work in relation to the notions of ‘form’ and ‘content’. In its template, the contents of the mind are always laid out on its metaphorical ‘mirror’ and only later
does the intellect give them an identity, or form, through interpretation. The content of a concept comes first and the mind then imposes form upon it. This is
important to our later discussions because both Hegel and Peirce maintain that
this order effect can be reversed. They argue that form can initiate human knowledge and that content can subsequently impact upon it. This is anathema to the

7 The Aristotelian account of perception is interesting in that the human mind is seen as
being relatively passive in experience. As Rorty highlights, a form, or essence, simply gets into
the mind of the perceiver – it is not perceived by a mind and then actively interpreted. This
lingering passivity in human perception is still partially evident in the philosophy of Hume.
Even for this arch-empiricist, the sense data that the mind perceives are construed as sense
impressions. This terminology, in itself, suggests that there is some latent passivity retained in
his perceptual model.

1.1 The ‘mirror of nature’

29

secondary dualist who is believes that the provision of form is the preserve of the
active mind.
In this secondary dualist structure, of course, the imposition of form onto
content also entails that meaning making is the sole responsibility of the interpreting mind. The images received on the ‘mirror’ of the mind lack any intrinsic
meaning. As Whitehead observes, this results in a view of the physical world
which is entirely devoid of meaning. He notes that nature is “a dull affair,
soundless, scentless, colourless; merely the hurrying of material, endlessly,
meaninglessly” (Whitehead 1995: 69). The lack of intrinsic meaning in the
world is a common theme in modern philosophy; it is another offspring of
‘secondary dualism’.
Finally, we should also touch on one further consequence of this cognitive
model. It was noted earlier that the secondary dualist contends that the mind
has direct access to its sense data. This can lead to the belief that such sense
data can act as a foundation for human knowledge (Derry 2013: 126–132). Foundationalist views are espoused, for example, by Bertrand Russell and his notion
of ‘direct acquaintance’ (Russell 1959), whilst Ayer argues that propositions
about the world cannot be maintained unless they can be validated by direct
observation (Ayer 1936). Such positions are supported, however, by the secondary dualist belief that the mind knows the identity of such validating (or, indeed, invalidating) sense data.
At this point, Wilfrid Sellars asks whether the claim to know the identity of
our sense data is justified. In his ‘Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind’ (Sellars
1997), Sellars maintains that such a view entails the claim that the mind experiences its sensations in a non-inferential way. Attacking this position, Sellars questions whether the intellect can, indeed, know the identity of a particular sense
datum without comparing it with something else. He concludes this is not possible; the mind can only know the identity of a particular sense datum inferentially
and that, as a result, human perceptions are, necessarily, relational entities. Sellars describes the invalid assumption that the mind knows the identity of its sense
data as the ‘Myth of the Given’ and he states that “being a sense datum, or sensum, is a relational property of the item that is sensed” (Sellars 1997: 15). And it
follows from this conclusion that perceptions cannot act in a foundational manner. As Rorty concludes (1997: 4–5), following Sellars, “we cannot do what some
logical positivists hoped to do [..]. In particular, we cannot perform such an analysis by discovering the ‘foundation’ of empirical knowledge in the objects of ‘direct
acquaintance’, which are ‘immediately before the mind’”.
As was noted above, Sellars acknowledges that this philosophical position
has certain similarities with Hegel. Indeed, he describes them as being “incipient

30

Meditations Hegeliènnes” (Sellars 1997: 45). Sellars does not enquire whether the
same view is adopted by Peirce, but this is, in fact, the case. Hegel and Peirce are
united in their early rejection of the ‘Myth of the Given’. And this shared insight
forms the starting point for their respective accounts of perception and concept
formation.

1.2 Problems with ‘secondary dualism’
It has already been noted that the cognitive model of ‘secondary dualism’ can
be challenged in several ways.8 It places the human intellect in a position
where it can neither see ‘behind’, nor ‘between’, its sense perceptions. It transforms each sense datum into an individual, atomised, and isolated element
8 Alva Noë is also a critic of ‘secondary dualism’. Whilst he does use this specific term, he
emphasises how this model employs visual metaphors to understand cognition, calling this
the “snapshot conception of visual experience” (Noë 2004: 35). He argues, like Peirce, that the
mind is, in fact, embedded in the world (Noë 2004: 24), and that it does not experience reality
as a series of ‘pictures’. In contrast to ‘secondary dualism’, Noë suggests, in his ‘enactive’
model, that human perception is more like the sense of touch: “vision is touch-like. Like
touch, vision is active” (Noë 2004: 73). He also maintains that “to perceive you must be in possession of sensorimotor bodily skill” (Noë 2004: 11). Such active skills enable the human mind
to work out how perceptions change according to perspective etc. This creates an important
parallel with two aspects of Peircean thought.
Firstly, Peirce’s concept of secondness enables the human mind to find its limits in the
world. Noë suggests, likewise, that “the process of perceiving, of finding out how things are, is
a process of meeting the world; it is an activity of skilful exploration (my italics) (Noë 2004:
164). In this context, is not surprising to find that Noë, like Hegel and Peirce, seeks to revise
where the line between the perceptual and the conceptual should be drawn. He maintains that
“I propose that we should think of sensorimotor skills as themselves conceptual, or ‘protoconceptual’ skills. Sensorimotor skills can play much of the role that concepts have been
called on to play in Kantian theories of perceptual experience (such as McDowell’s)” (Noë
2004: 183). And, moreover, Noë suggests that these skills allow the mind to move from indeterminate, to more determinate, perceptions in a manner that echoes the action of Peirce’s category of secondness (Noë 2004: 193).
Secondly, Noë makes a distinction between two forms of perception. He often speaks of “a
duality of content” (Noë 2004: 163). He argues that “perceptual content has a dual aspect.
There’s the way experience presents the world as being, as it were apart from your perspective.
This is one aspect of its content. And there is the way the world is presented in experience, a
way that always incorporates some reference to how things look or sound or feel from your
vantage point” (Noë 2004: 163). This distinction appears to parallel the respective roles of the
icon and the index for Peirce. The former provides the pure ‘form’, without any empirical baggage, whilst the latter embeds the ‘object of thought’ in the world through the relationships
between it and the perceiver (see chapter 10).

1.2 Problems with ‘secondary dualism’

31

laid on the metaphorical ‘mirror’ of the mind. It is no surprise, as a result, that
this leads to the philosophical scepticism advocated by Hume.
At a purely intuitive level, however, there seems to be something incorrect
about the model. The empirical world does not unfold before our eyes as a series of atomised perceptions which are spontaneously linked together by the
mind. Instead, it is experienced, quite naturally, as a continuum and from this
continuum the mind picks out different phenomena such as objects, qualities,
and events. This counters the perceptual model espoused by Locke and Hume.
In due course, this idea of a perceptual continuum will be encountered again; it
represents a key feature of Peirce’s account of perception; it is what he terms
‘synechism’ (EP1: 363).
But there is another aspect of ‘secondary dualism’ which undercuts its validity. The model places sense data on one side of its mental divide and the intellect
on the other. But there must be something incorrect about this perspective because, evidently, both elements are inside the mind. The model thus assumes
that human sense data form a kind of reified experience. They are in the mind,
but they enjoy a special status there. They are present in the same way that images are reflected in mirrors and, as such, they possess quasi ‘external’ characteristics. This is clearly at odds with their fundamentally mental status. Secondary
dualism thus seems to want it both ways. It asserts that the mind possesses two
types of entity – one that has phenomenological (and real?) properties and another (the inspecting mind) that is intellectual. The divisions of ‘primary’ dualism
are thus re-created, but they are now located within the mind itself. This is a philosophical sleight of hand which often goes unnoticed. Secondary dualists claim
to have overcome the problem of the ‘veil of perception’ (by claiming direct access to the mind’s sense data) but, in fact, they have reformulated the original
dualist problem in phenomenological form.
But there is also another, and more fundamental, weakness in this cognitive
model. As noted earlier, the model suggests that there is a division between the
mind’s known sense data (in the ‘mirror’) and the mind’s subsequent interpretation of them. But, following Sellars, this template can now be challenged. If the
identity of a sense datum is, in fact, unknowable, then the binary distinctions
which the model sets up are seriously undermined. The secondary dualist insists
that the mind knows the identity of a particular sense datum, but it fails to recognise that such direct perceptual knowledge is an interpretation because the sense

Having said this, Noë does not invoke semiotic terminology and he has no use for Peirce’s
‘categories’. His work, however, represents a persuasive contemporary attack on ‘secondary
dualism’ which echoes several aspects of Peirce’s philosophy.

32

1 The model of ‘secondary dualism’

data has already been given an identity. As a result, the secondary dualist model
entails interpretation on both sides of its claimed dichotomy.
At this point, the foundations of ‘secondary dualism’ begin to dissolve
away. It is no longer possible to position the mind as being relative to its
known sense data. Advocates of ‘secondary dualism’ can, of course, respond by
falling back to a deeper position. They can accept that the mind does not, in
fact, know the identity of its sense data and agree that it only experiences such
sense data in the form of perceptual hypotheses. But, with this move, the dualistic structure of the model evaporates since secondary dualists can no longer
divide human cognition into neat binary categories of the ‘known’ and the ‘interpreted’. Equally, if everything is a hypothesis, the intellect must abandon its
‘sideways view’ of reality. Instead, the mind becomes immersed in its perceptions, and it tries to make sense of them by forming hypotheses. As will be seen
in chapter four, this is precisely the position espoused by Hegel, Peirce, and
Vygotsky. They begin their individual accounts of human perception by readily
accepting that the mind cannot know the identity of its sense data and that it
must make do with perceptual hypotheses.
However, before commencing a detailed analysis of the relationships between Hegel, Peirce, and Vygotsky, it is important to understand how ‘secondary dualism’ has impacted upon modern semiotics. As a discipline, semiotics is
concerned with how meaning is created, and it maintains that the ‘sign’ forms
the centrepiece of such endeavours. It is highly relevant, therefore, to understand the influence of ‘secondary dualism’ on modern semiotic theory. When
this is explored, it becomes clear that such theory has seldom confronted the
issues inherent in ‘secondary dualism’. Many semioticians have, in fact, accepted its perceptual template without question, or have adopted a framework
of ‘interpretation’ without recognising that this approach to meaning making
finds its roots in a particular model of cognition.
As a result, it is useful to carry out a brief overview of twentieth century
semiotics and to establish how much of modern semiotic theory has, in fact,
been predicated on the assumptions of ‘secondary dualism’. Such an analysis
will also help uncover the truly distinctive nature of Peirce’s own semiotic
theory.

2 Semiotics and ‘secondary dualism’
The influence of ‘secondary dualism’ reaches across many aspects of contemporary philosophy. The full extent of its dominance is evident, as has been noted,
in the way that it successfully underpins both the tradition of Western scientific
thought and Humean scepticism. The dualism that it entails drives a pervasive
separation of meaning from experience. The mistaken belief that the mind knows
the identity of its sense data leads to the conclusion that human knowledge is
interpretative, subjective, or ideological in nature.
In this chapter, we will explore how this cognitive model has also infiltrated
semiotic thinking. Such an analysis is critical to understanding Peirce because,
as a philosopher writing under the influence of Hegel, he was keenly aware of
the problems that ‘secondary dualism’ entails. Indeed, Peirce’s semiotics can
even be characterised, in part, as a systematic attempt to avoid these philosophical difficulties.
In the course of this brief overview of modern semiotic theory, some key aspects of Peirce’s thinking will be touched upon in order to illustrate the distance
that exists between his own thought and that of ‘secondary dualism’. Readers
who are already familiar with Peirce may find some of these comparisons initially surprising. But the differences discussed are, in fact, an illustration of how
commentators have tended to marginalise Peirce’s own views on perception. If
we view Peirce, however, from a Hegelian perspective it is possible to identify
the points of difference that exist between Peirce and the modern semiological
tradition.
This chapter will begin with a brief evaluation of Saussure as one of the key
founders of modern semiotics. As will be observed, Saussure accepts, and indeed embraces, the core assumptions of ‘secondary dualism’. Our discussion
will then consider other developments in late twentieth century semiotics.
These have taken the discipline in directions which, to varying degrees, have
also subscribed to the core tenets of ‘secondary dualism’. But this has not prevented such attempts from enrolling Peirce in their analyses.

2.1 The Saussurean tradition
Early developments in twentieth-century semiotics were heavily indebted to linguistics and Saussure’s own background in this specialism had the effect of
pushing the emerging discipline in directions that were linguistic in orientation.

34

2 Semiotics and ‘secondary dualism’

This shifted the potential focus of semiotics away from the deeper epistemological issues that had been the main concern of Peirce.
However, Saussure does not just ignore these philosophical issues; more
damagingly, he adopts a theoretical position that entails significant philosophical consequences, and he does so without recognising its effects. In particular,
Saussure accepts ‘secondary dualism’ so completely that his distinction between
the signifier and the signified is one of its more distinctive expressions. In Saussure’s model of the sign, the ‘signifier’ replaces the image in the ‘mirror’ of the
mind and the ‘signified’ is the mind’s interpretation of it. And, moreover, in line
with the interpretative ‘gap’ entailed by this model, Saussure celebrates these
two features as being connected on an arbitrary basis. In other words, Saussure
re-affirms the framework of ‘secondary dualism’ and expresses it in semiological
terms.
Following the assumptions of ‘secondary dualism’, Saussure argues that
meaning is created, not through reference to the world, but through the place of
each signifying unit within a system of ‘langue’. He explains (Saussure 2012: 107)
that “just as the game of chess is entirely in the combination of the different chess
pieces, language is characterised as a system based entirely on the opposition of
its concrete units”. And it follows from this that Saussure’s sign theory is synchronic in character. Not only does he detach meanings from the world, but he
also provides little account of how such meanings can be created, or how they
might evolve over time. His position is inevitable given that Saussure’s engine of
meaning-making is already sealed off from reality through his ready acceptance
of ‘secondary dualism’. Saussure’s revolutionary step is to argue that meaning is
created within a structured system (langue), but what he is really doing, like
Hume before him, is to expound a theory of meaning creation which is fundamentally divorced from reality.
But Saussure’s sign system still needs to be rooted in reality in some way or
other; otherwise, his system of linkages between signifiers and signifieds would
have no footing in reality whatsoever. And so, it becomes clear that Saussure embraces the contradictory position highlighted earlier. On the one hand, he proclaims that meanings are arbitrary whilst, on the other, he quietly accepts that
we know the identity of each signifier. The underlying weakness of his position
becomes even more evident if his account of meaning making is analysed in
more detail. He claims, for example, that meaning is formed by the differences
within an ‘associative axis’. Meaning derives, therefore, from the position of a
term within a system of other and similar terms (Saussure 2012: 115):

2.1 The Saussurean tradition

35

To resolve this issue, let us observe from the outset that even outside of language, all
values are apparently governed by the same paradoxical principle. They are always
composed:
1) Of a dissimilar thing that can be exchanged for the thing of which the value is to be
determined; and
2) Of similar things that can be compared with the thing of which the value is to be
determined.
Both factors are necessary for the existence of a value. To determine what a five-franc
piece is worth one must therefore know: (1) that it can be exchanged for a fixed quantity
of a different thing, e.g., bread; and (2) that it can be compared with a similar value of the
same system, e.g., a one-franc piece or with coins of another system (a dollar, etc.). In the
same way a word can be exchanged for something dissimilar, an idea; besides it can be
compared with something of the same nature, another word.

Saussure, therefore, claims that a word can be compared “with something of the
same nature”. But how is this to be, in fact, achieved? How can Saussure place
an element on an ‘associative axis’ without invoking some pre-existing knowledge of the signifier? What tells him (apart from some assumed boundary to the
‘associative’ axis) that a word can be “compared with something of the same nature, another word”? How can he judge what ‘same nature’ is? Could a panda,
for example, be in the same ‘associative axis’ as the Empire State Building? It
soon becomes clear that Saussure lacks a criterion to define similarity.9 And this
can only be established if he already assumes that he knows the identity of the
signifier and the ‘associative’ axis to which it must belong. This finding fundamentally undermines his model of meaning making; Saussure has unconditionally signed up to the ‘Myth of the Given’.
In the mid-twentieth century, Barthes follows Saussure in adopting the
same dyadic structure for the sign and he also insists on its arbitrary nature. He
states, for example, that “if I learn the highway code in an empirical (extra linguistic) manner, I perceive differences, not qualities: red, green, yellow have
(for me) no reality other than their relation, the play of their oppositions . . . .”
(Barthes 1990: 30). Equally, his ‘commutation test’ repeats Saussure’s mistake
of assuming knowledge of the identity of the signifier and the paradigm to
which it must belong. Barthes, for example, argues that this test identifies ‘commutative classes’ as follows: “suppose we have a structure given in its entirety.
The commutation test consists of artificially varying one term of this structure

9 This objection to Saussure is, in fact, a very old one. It is levelled at John Locke by George
Berkeley. When Locke argued that it was possible for the mind to identify similarities in sense
data when forming a universal, Berkeley pointed out that Locke would need some criterion to
evaluate such a similarity (Bennett 1971: 24). This is precisely the problem that Saussure has
here – he can only assert that similarity exists by already knowing a basis for it.

36

2 Semiotics and ‘secondary dualism’

and observing whether this variation introduces change in reading or the usage
of the given structure . . . .” (Barthes 1990: 19). But, as discussed above, this
only works if Barthes imposes a limit on what might constitute the ‘structure’
and any potential ‘variation’ that might be introduced. Both Saussure and
Barthes claim they have uncovered the underlying mechanisms of meaning
making, but, in fact, they have simply identified how meaning changes within
an established system of meaning. They both leave the deeper question of how
meaning is formed ab initio entirely unexplored.10
Elsewhere, in his ‘Mythologies’, Barthes (2009) extends the notion of the sign
with his concept of ‘myth’. This introduces a further level of meaning creation,
this time at a cultural level. He claims that the ‘myth’ involves the production of
new identities within a culture. Interestingly, for our later discussion of Hegel
and Peirce, Barthes describes these identities as ‘essences’, or ‘forms’, and he
provides several examples (e.g., “Frenchness” and “militariness” (Barthes 2009:
139). However, because the original sign is still created arbitrarily, this means
that, for Barthes, such identities remain detached from ‘reality’; they are cultural
constructions. In an example, Barthes discusses the ‘basquity’ of a house in
Paris. This essence is based on the similarity of this building to houses in Spain.
He views it, however, not as a phenomenon that really exists in the world, but as
one that is created by culture. Interestingly, this leads him to conclude that the
‘myth’ of ‘basquity’ is a “deformation” of reality (Barthes 2009: 146). Barthes is,
therefore, convinced there must be an intrinsic ‘refraction’ of reality in semiotics
because the sign entails a cultural interpretation. This conclusion, of course,
stems from ‘secondary dualism’ which construes interpretations (whether individual or cultural) as dualistically separate from perception.
The conviction that cultural interpretations distort reality also finds expression in the work of Umberto Eco. He expounds his position by arguing that signs
always entail a refraction of reality. He views the human sciences, for example,
as “interpretations of interpretations” (Eco 2018: 349) and observes that “semiotics is in principle the discipline studying everything which can be used in order

10 The distinction that Saussure and Barthes make between a signifier and the associative
axis to which it belongs also emerges in the semiotic urge to identify different expressions of a
particular concept or conceptual content. These expressions are often construed as ‘cultural
codes’ of that content. In some contexts, this idea is extrapolated to suggest that there are
dominant, emergent and residual ‘codes’ in a culture. But this distinction between expressions
and content is predicated on the assumption that a particular content can first be identified
and that different expressions of it then manifest themselves. This is possible in the second
dimension, in Figure 1, when a known value is being communicated, but it does not explain
how a particular concept is formed.

to lie [..] I think that the definition of a ‘theory of the lie’ should be taken as a
pretty comprehensive program of a general semiotics” (Eco 1976: 7). And Eco
concurs with Barthes in suggesting that the social dimension is at the heart of
semiotics; meaning is created by social convention. Eco, following Barthes, also
adopts the terminology of semiotic ‘codes’ and claims that “a sign function is the
correlation between an expression and a content based on a conventionally established code . . . .” (Eco 1976: 191). As Nöth points out, “it was Jacobson who,
under the influence of information theory, adopted the dichotomy of code and
message to replace the Saussurean langue and parole” (Nöth 1995: 210), but Eco’s
adoption of semiotic codes simply reflects the core tenets of ‘secondary dualism’;
codes enable the mind to bridge the divide between perception and meaning.
The argument that signs involve a distortion of reality finds one of its keenest
exponents in the work of the Russian author, Vološinov. In his view, the social
realm consists of signs, and these must be ideological because they involve ‘refractions’ of the reality (Vološinov 1973: 9):
Any ideological product is not only itself a part of a reality (natural or social), just as is
any physical body, any instrument of production, or any other product for consumption,
it also, in contradistinction to these other phenomena, reflects and refracts another reality
outside itself. Everything ideological possesses meaning: it represents, depicts, or stands
for something lying outside itself. In other words, it is a sign. Without signs there is no
ideology.

Vološinov insists, therefore, that thoughts, themselves, are signs and, as such,
they refract human understanding in an ideological manner. But Vološinov
goes further; he also questions whether the mind itself should be construed as
an independent agent of inspection. He argues that it is determined by its semiotic contents and that, as a result “if we deprive consciousness of semiotic,
ideological content, it would have absolutely nothing left” (Vološinov 1973: 13).
Vološinov, therefore, not only claims that interpretations are distortions of reality; he also claims that human consciousness is ideological as well.
The work of Vološinov has been influential in the field of social semiotics.
This discipline differs from some other branches of semiotics by focussing specifically on how signs are used within a culture. It embraces the idea that signs are
ideological, and it suggests, in line with this, that semioticians should identify
how ‘semiotic resources’ are deployed by sign users to portray reality in a particular (and usually advantageous) manner. As a result, social semiotics, again,
makes little attempt to explain how meaning is created ab initio. Instead, it assumes that meanings already exist within a culture, as sensory resources (visual,
auditory etc), and its central concern is to understand how such meanings are
employed by sign users.

38

2 Semiotics and ‘secondary dualism’

It follows from this that social semiotics thus construes signs as being both
motivated and conventional. Social semiotics agrees with Saussure that signs are
conventional because signs are formed at a social level; they are endowed with
meanings derived from their previous manifestations in a culture. But it also rejects the Saussurean assertion that signs are arbitrary because they are used in a
way that is motivated by the needs of the sign user (Kress and Van Leeuwen
1996: 8). It is no surprise, in this context, that social semiotics echoes Barthes,
Eco and Vološinov in their assertion that signs involve a ‘distortion’ of reality.
Kress and Van Leeuwen claim, for example (1996: 154–155), that “from the point
of view of social semiotics, truth is a construct of semiosis, and as such the truth
of a particular social group arises from the values and beliefs of that group”.
Signs, in social semiotics, are not only cultural artefacts; they are employed, implicitly or explicitly, for ideological purposes.

2.2 Biosemiotics and the Umwelt
The emergence of biosemiotics, in the late twentieth century, represents an important step away from the focus on human culture and language which characterises the earlier work of Saussure, Barthes and Eco. As such, biosemiotics
takes the discipline in a direction that finds a potential ally in Peirce. Indeed,
many influential biosemioticians claim Peirce as a major influence (Hoffmeyer:
1996; Wheeler: 2006; Rodríguez Higuera: 2019). Peirce’s insistence on the triadic structure of the sign, his relational understanding of the universe, and his
belief that nature adopt ‘habits’ have been widely adopted by biosemioticians.
As Rodríguez Higuera (2019: 423) rightly observes “on the whole, a large majority of biosemiotics is conducted within the Peircean framework”.
In this context, however, it is important to analyse how biosemiotics tends to
construe cognition and, specifically, how it compares with our earlier critique of
‘secondary dualism’. As will be seen, biosemiotics makes significant strides away
from ‘secondary dualism’, but it is still held back by some lingering attachments
to this cognitive model. This claim is particularly relevant given that biosemiotics
often makes a claim to a Peircean heritage. Two issues, as a result of this, need to
be addressed: firstly, is biosemiotics justified in asserting that it is aligned to
Peirce? And, secondly, can the revised vision of Peircean semiotics, as proposed
in this essay, address some of the more contentious issues that exist in biosemiotics? The second question will be addressed in section 10.4 – after we have evaluated Hegel’s influence on Peirce. In particular, this later discussion will evaluate
the biosemiotic notions of the Umwelt and the lower semiotic threshold.

2.2 Biosemiotics and the Umwelt

39

To begin with, however, it is important to stress that there are some important
convergences between Peirce and biosemiotic theory. For example, biosemiotics
appears to offer a potential solution to the problem of dualism; it seems to close
the cognitive gap implicit in meaning making. As Hoffmeyer (1996: 94) explains:
To modern science, dualism still holds good as a way of dividing the world into two kingdoms, those of mind and of matter, the cultural and the natural spheres [..] And it is this
boundary that biosemiotics seeks to cross in hopes of establishing a link between the two
alienated sides of our existence – to give humanity its place in nature.

This view concurs with Peirce’s rejection of dualism which he describes as a
philosophy which “performs its analyses with an axe” (EP2: 2). But care should
be taken to identify exactly which philosophical problem is being addressed
here. Hoffmeyer, writing as a biologist, sees biosemiotics as a means of overcoming the gap between the mind and external reality. But, as noted earlier,
this is the problem of ‘primary dualism’. What needs to be asked is whether biosemiotics addresses the quite separate issue of ‘secondary dualism’. Hoffmeyer’s
main target in ‘Signs of Meaning in the Universe’ is the ‘physicalist’ perspective of
modern biology (Barbieri 2016: 2), but does biosemiotics address the dualism implicit in the ‘mirror model’?
At the centre of any such discussion is the biosemiotic concept of the Umwelt. This notion, initiated by Jakob von Uexküll, argues that the experiences of
a particular species are determined by its sensory apparatus. As a result, different species may encounter the same physical environment, but they experience
it in different ways. This qualitative difference is determined by a creature’s underlying ability to grasp the species-specific signs that exist in the environment.
And Nöth confirms this view, maintaining that the “Umwelt, in this sense, is
the way in which the environment is represented to the organism’s mind, and it
comprises the scope of the organism’s operational interaction with its environment” (Nöth 1998: 4). Elsewhere, Deely (2009: 42–43) argues that the Umwelt is
also compatible with his own interpretation of pre-modern thinking:
It is a semiotic point of the first importance that things fully become signs (vehicles of
signification) within the experience of animals, a whole to which the human being is but
a part; and this experience whereby the action of signs transforms environment into an
objective world or Umwelt not only presupposes awareness on the side of the animals as
subjective entities, it also supposes a whole network or web of relationships linking animal and environment not merely in the order of ens reale [. . .], but both together as parts
within a larger whole which is not simply “there”, like rocks on the moon, but is there as
a world meaningful to the animal, a surroundings structured objectively in terms of what
is to be sought (+), what is to be avoided (-), and what seems safe to ignore (0) – a world
of objects, in short, not wholly reducible to things existing apart from awareness.

40

2 Semiotics and ‘secondary dualism’

In these accounts of the Umwelt, therefore, reality is “represented to the organism’s mind” in a particular fashion and this is wholly dependent on the “constitution of the organism doing the sensing” (Deely 2001: 127). And, as Cobley asserts,
“put simply, an animal’s Umwelt is its ‘objective world’: it is the world that it lives
in, how it apprehends everything around itself (and even within itself); yet, at the
same time, that apprehension takes place on the very basis of the sensory apparatus that it possesses” (Cobley 2009: 8).
However, if this biosemiotic position is evaluated through the framework of
‘secondary dualism’, it becomes clear that a degree of dualism is still present in
its overall approach. For it still adheres to a binary view of nature: a physical
world and a species-specific interpretation of it. Romanini recognises this, and
correctly observes that biosemiotics has been tempted to learn “Peirce’s doctrine
of signs . . . through commentators that have hidden Peirce’s objective idealism
under the carpet” (Romanini 2014: 227).
In the biosemiotic view, therefore, an Umwelt is constructed by each animal
using the sensory elements offered to it by the physical world. The Umwelt of each
species is then constructed from, or upon, these elements and a sense of dualism
still seems to be preserved. To avoid this charge, biosemioticians often claim that
what an organism experiences are, in fact, species-specific signs which are predefined as being interpretable (because an animal belongs to a particular species).
The organism thus experiences its world phenomenologically through its own species-specific signs. The Umwelt, in this view, simultaneously fuses animal experience with semiotic interpretation. The organism only perceives meaningful signs;
the two cannot be pulled apart. This forms the underlying basis of the biosemiotic
claim to overcome dualism. But two important observations question the extent to
which this biosemiotic solution is following in the Peircean tradition.
Firstly, this approach suggests that a phenomenological theory of ‘direct acquaintance’ is at work here, but it is now elevated to a semiotic level. The Umwelt
is construed as a series of species-specific meanings that only a particular species
has access to. As Kull (2010: 45) explains “the objects in an Umwelt have a bearing
on the behaviour of the organism, because objects, as components of signs, are
(by definition) meaningful”. Semiotic meaning is thus already embedded in the
perceptual acts of an organism because such meaning has been reframed speciesspecifically. These biosemiotic parallels with phenomenology can also be found in
its discussion of the mind-body distinction. Merleau-Ponty, in his ‘Phenomenology
of Perception’, rejects this Cartesian division. Attacking this view, he suggests that
mind is, in fact, “embodied” (Merleau Ponty 2012: 40). Within biosemiotic theory,
there is a similar urge to merge the dualistically separated concepts of mind and
body. Both Wheeler (2006: 18) and Hoffmeyer (1996: 88) suggest that we should
think in terms of the “body-mind” and that this is the centre of human experience.

2.2 Biosemiotics and the Umwelt

41

Brier, likewise, suggests that “the thing in itself is not only ‘outside’ in nature, but
also inside ourselves, if I understand Peirce correctly” (Brier 2008: 334).
Secondly, and linked to this phenomenological stance, is the biosemiotic
view that an organism ‘models’ its world. This position has overtones of a constructivist nature. Kull highlights this aspect of biosemiotics when he states that
“organisms make the world. Umwelt does not mean just a recognition of objects
in the world, nor is it confined to remembering (including all forms of memory) –
it is just as much a manufacturing of the world” (Kull 2010: 46). Cobley agrees
with this view, stating that “all species live in a ‘world’ that is constructed out of
their own signs, the latter being the result of their own sign-making and receiving capacities” (Cobley 2010: 4). And Pablé (2020: 128) observes that “the objective world is constituted by how the animal maps the world through its Innenwelt
(the inner, subjective world) through which the meanings of objects are determined (via signs)”. As a result, it is possible to detect a constructivist tenor in
this biosemiotic approach even though it is separate, as a discipline, from social
constructivism. This conclusion is confirmed when Brier advances the notion of
“bioconstructivism” and suggests that every living system constructs “its own
‘life world’” (Brier 2008: 339).
The biosemiotic notions of ‘mapping’ and ‘modelling’, however, need to be
treated extremely carefully. The central problem revolves, again, around the idea
of dualism. The terms themselves can easily suggest that an organism constructs
its own separate reality (its Umwelt). ‘Maps’ and ‘models’ are, after all, versions
of something else. One of the key issues, therefore, is whether biosemiotic modelling involves a separate constructed entity that remains relative to the physical
world. As Randviir states “in modelling everything is concerned with everything,
and everything is relative” (Randviir 2019: 9). But if biosemiotic ‘mapping’ involves relativism, then it would seem to adhere to a view of cognition that is
closely aligned with ‘secondary dualism’. As has been highlighted, this model involves the mind creating an interpretive understanding of the world that is both
separate from reality and relative to its sense data.
Linked to this, there is also the allied question of how interactions between
the constructed ‘model’ and the world might take place. In most construals of
‘modelling’ feedback loops do exist. Kull (2010: 46–47), for example, talks of
“functional cycles” which help build an organism’s Umwelt. But it is important to
specify exactly what is involved here. It has been noted, for example, that Deely
separates the Umwelt of an organism into elements which are positive, negative,
or neutral, but this does not mean that the organism’s ‘map’ is ‘connected’
with the world except through the mechanism of further ‘interpretation’.

42

2 Semiotics and ‘secondary dualism’

What is required, if some form of interpretative constructivism is to be avoided, is
a biosemiotic account of how an organism’s meanings can be revised in a nondualistic fashion.11
The phenomenological and constructivist aspects of biosemiotics are important in this essay because, as will be discussed in due course, Peirce rejects both
philosophical tendencies. His own account of reality is non-dualistic in nature,
and he views the semiotic ‘construction’ that is created within his own philosophy as a joint venture between the mind and reality. Indeed, Peirce gives an active role to reality itself in the formation of meaning (through his notion of
secondness) and the outcome of such meaning making is a form of synthetic reality which is much more than a ‘construction’ of the mind. As such, Peirce
might well reject the notion of ‘mapping’ as it is currently understood in modern
biosemiotics. Overall, as a discipline, biosemiotics addresses the problems of ‘primary dualism’, but its phenomenological and constructivist tendencies would indicate that it has not fully escaped the grasp of ‘secondary dualism’.
This lingering adherence to the elements of ‘secondary dualism’ also emerges
in another and important way. As highlighted earlier, the ‘mirror’ model assumes
that the mind creates meaning by interpreting its sense data. In the hands of Vološinov, or Barthes, these meanings are subjective distortions, or refractions, of reality. At first glance, this problem seems to be circumvented in biosemiotics because
these ‘interpretations’ of reality have validity at a species-specific level. But it is
evident that the notion of ‘interpretation’ has a fundamental role in biosemiotic
theory and is employed by many biosemioticians to describe the action of signs
(Hoffmeyer 1996: 95; Kull 2018: 359). Indeed, Hoffmeyer goes so far as to propose
that everything from cell action to the behaviour of animals should be explained
by this intellectual activity. In doing so, Hoffmeyer effectively expands the idea of
‘interpretation’ to include not just the mental activities of higher organisms, but
also the action of cells themselves (Hoffmeyer 1996: 95):

11 Cobley also highlights the ways in which biosemioticians have sometimes divided the idea
of ‘modelling’ into three distinct types (Cobley 2016: 35). These are ‘primary modelling’ which
is “the capacity for verbal and non-verbal communication”, ‘secondary modelling’ which involves “verbal communication through vocal interactions” – which includes the use of signs.
Lastly, there is ‘tertiary modelling’ which comprises the “inevitable mutation in social exchange of primary and secondary modelling to produce cultural forms. . .which not only partake of the lower strata of modelling but also feed back to them”. These three levels of
modelling can easily be construed as reflecting Peirce’s three categories. Indeed, Cobley observes that Sebeok and Danesi (2000) attempt to argue this case (Cobley 2016: 36). But these
models, even though they may loosely mirror the categories of Peirce, are a far cry from his
three categories of ‘Being’ which revolve around indeterminacy, subsequent limitation, and
the creation of ‘thirds’.

2.2 Biosemiotics and the Umwelt

43

Or, to use the metaphor that keeps cropping up in this book: Inside us there is ‘someone’.
Life is based on the principle of ‘someone’ inside ‘someone’ inside ‘someone’ inside . . .
What emerges, when the authority for interpreting and making decisions is delegated to
organs, tissues, and cells, is a hierarchical network of sign processes the accumulated
output of which constitutes the coordinated actions of the organism.

And it is on this basis that biosemiotic claim is made that the universe is a web of
being in which everything is interpreted and re-interpreted. But, as noted earlier,
the notion of interpretation itself is a feature of the secondary dualist model. Far
from addressing the serious issues that this template raises, it would appear,
therefore, that Hoffmeyer expands its framework to include all parts of the organism. Rather than rejecting what is, potentially, a flawed model of cognition, he
reframes the entire natural world within its remit.
This leads to a critical question for this current essay: what is Peirce’s position
on the notion of interpretation? The assertion that he offers modern semioticians
an account of the sign based on interpretation has formed a cornerstone of Peircean exegesis both within, and outside, biosemiotics (e.g., Campbell, Olteanu,
Kull 2019: 357). Indeed, it is often maintained that Peirce’s triadic structure of the
sign differs from Saussure’s precisely because he advocates an interpretative system rather than one based on ‘codes’. Petrilli, for example, argues that contemporary semiotics has embraced “‘interpretation semiotics’ thanks in particular to the
recovery of Charles S. Peirce” (Petrilli 2014: 2). Equally, Barbieri makes a similar
claim regarding Peirce when he distinguishes two different approaches in biosemiotics (Barbieri 2009: 234):
This is the great difference between the above schools of biosemiotics. Sign biosemiotics
is based on the Peircean approach and assumes that semiosis is about interpreting the
world. Code biosemiotics is based on the code model and assumes that semiosis is primarily about bringing objects into existence and organizing them into functioning
structures.

But one of the central claims of this essay is that Peirce would reject the idea that
signs are formed through interpretation. Instead, it is proposed that Peircean semiotics should be re-evaluated on this critical point. Critically, it will be proposed
that Peirce construes meaning making as a matter of sublation, rather than of interpretation, and this activity takes place when the interpretant is formed within
the sign.
This is a proposition that many readers may find hard to accept. But it is one
which becomes evident once the Hegelian context of Peircean semiotics is uncovered. There are, of course, many occasions when Peirce adopts the language of
‘interpretation’, but he tends to use the term in a way that is quite different from
secondary dualists. For Peirce, interpretation does not entail the intellect looking

44

2 Semiotics and ‘secondary dualism’

in its mental ‘mirror’ and giving meaning to a particular sense datum. Instead,
for him, the mind is immersed in signs (CP5: 289) and the interpretant (e.g., the
sign’s meaning) is the outcome of a specific form of sign activity (see section
6.6). This conclusion serves, as we shall see, to create considerable distance between biosemiotics and the Peircean legacy.
There is one other aspect of biosemiotics which should also be highlighted in
relation to Peirce. This is the way in which biosemioticians sometimes adopt the
notion of ‘codes’. Hoffmeyer, again, does this relatively frequently. He talks, for
example, about “code duality” (Hoffmeyer 1996: 44). The notion of the semiotic
code, however, finds no origins in the Peircean tradition. Instead, it has its roots,
as highlighted above, in secondary dualist thinking. The semiotic code is how the
‘gap’ between human perceptions and meanings can be crossed; it facilitates the
transition from the signifier to the signified. The idea of codes has much appeal to
biologists such as Barbieri (2008) and Pattee (2007, 2015) because it resonates with
their discipline’s notion of genetic codes, but it is also clear that the idea of ‘codes’
originates in ‘secondary dualism’ and its requirement to move from the images in
the ‘mirror’ of the mind to the meaning that is subsequently given to them.
Authors such as Barbieri, however, suggest that biosemiotics should move
towards an even greater focus on codes. He sees this as a way of shifting attention away from what he (mistakenly) construes as the more ‘interpretative’ (and
Peircean) leanings of biosemiotics. In his view, codes work at a fundamentally
organic level. He argues that (Barbieri 2008: 587):
Any organic code is a set of rules that establish a correspondence between two independent worlds, and this necessarily requires molecular structures that act like adaptors, i.e.,
that perform two independent recognition processes. The adaptors are required because
the two worlds would no longer be independent if there were a necessary link between them,
and a set of rules is required in order to guarantee the specificity of the correspondence.

This quotation amounts, however, to an exemplary explanation of how codes
work within the secondary dualist model; they allow a passage from one ‘independent world’ to another. Barbieri thus attacks what he sees as a “Peirce industry” (Barbieri 2015: 168), but his advocacy of codes both reinforces the
influence of ‘secondary dualism’ within biosemiotics and mistakenly assumes
that Peirce’s semiotics is interpretative in nature.
In summary, biosemiotics makes significant steps away from the Saussurean
model and it establishes new ways of thinking outside the boundaries of linguistics
and culture. But it largely achieves this by expanding the notion of ‘interpretation’
into the biological field and this serves to reinforce, rather than address, the problems of ‘secondary dualism’. Moreover, biosemiotic theory also displays other features which suggest both a constructivist and phenomenological approach. As a

2.2 Biosemiotics and the Umwelt

45

result, it can be argued that modern biosemiotics is positioned at some distance
from the intellectual heritage of Peirce. This claim will be substantiated in the
course of the following chapters as the Hegelian influence on Peirce is uncovered.
Having said this, however, the account of Peircean semiotics that will
emerge in the following sections will also demonstrate that biosemiotics, as a
discipline, has much to gain from a more Hegelian construal of Peirce. These
opportunities for the further development of biosemiotics will be discussed, in
section 10.4, when our analysis revisits the notion of the Umwelt and explores
the idea of the ‘lower semiotic threshold’.

3 Hegel, Peirce, and Vygotsky: Models
of perception
So far, it has been noted that one of the foundations of ‘secondary dualism’ is
the questionable belief that the mind knows the identity of its sense data. It has
been suggested that if perceptions are mere hypotheses, rather than forms of
knowledge, then the model collapses. All that remains is the frank acknowledgment that perceptions are, in the words of Hegel and Peirce, ‘indeterminate’.
This may seem, at first sight, to constitute an epistemological failure, but, in
fact, it marks the starting point of the perceptual model that Hegel, Peirce and
Vygotsky espouse. It involves a rejection of what Hegel (1977: 58–66) calls
‘sense certainty’ and it is with this notion that our analysis should begin.

3.1 Hegel on perception
Central to Hegel’s discussion of perception is his rejection of Kantian ‘intuitionism’ – the belief that the mind can grasp the immediate content of its perceptions.
This view has already been encountered, in modern form, in the ‘Myth of the
Given’. Over a century earlier, however, Hegel (1977: 58) asserts that “sensecertainty appears to be the truest knowledge; for it has not as yet omitted anything
from the object, but it has the object before it in its perfect entirety. But, in the
event, this very certainty proves itself to be the most abstract and poorest truth”.
Rejecting ‘sense certainty’ Hegel argues that perceptions do not constitute
immediate knowledge. He asserts this in his account of ‘indeterminate Being’
when he argues that “Pure Being makes the beginning: because it is on the one
hand pure thought, and on the other immediacy itself, simple and indeterminate;
and the first beginning cannot be mediated by anything or be further determined” (Hegel 2014: 101). Hegel thus conceives the mind’s experience of Being
as both “immediate” (i.e., not behind Locke’s “veil of perception”) and yet still
“indeterminate”. He, therefore, rejects the views of philosophers such as Locke
and Hume, who insist that the mind possesses immediate knowledge of its sense
impressions. Hegel argues that “in Empiricism lies the great principle that whatever is true must be in the actual world and present to sensation” (Hegel 2014:
49) but he suggests that empiricism “asserts that immediate knowledge is a fact.
It has been shown to be untrue in fact to say that there is immediate knowledge,
a knowledge without mediation either by means of something else or in itself”
(Hegel 2014: 87).

https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110695854-004

3.1 Hegel on perception

47

In this second passage, Hegel hints at his further claim that the human
mind can only come to know the identity of its sense data through mediation.
How such mediated knowledge might be created will be discussed shortly, but
a key characteristic of Hegel’s position is that it comprises both the perceptual
and the intellectual. This form of ‘mediated’ knowledge is sometimes construed
by Hegel in terms of “thought-forms” or “thought-types” (Hegel 2014: 27–28):
And in order to prevent misconception, thought-form or thought-type should be substituted for the ambiguous term thought. From what has been said the principles of logic
are to be sought in a system of thought-types or fundamental categories, in which the
opposition between subjective and objective, in its usual sense, vanishes.

These Hegelian ‘thought-forms’ are quite unlike the ‘interpretations’ of sense
data encountered in ‘secondary dualism’. In contrast, they are ‘amalgams’ of
the mental and the empirical. This Hegelian theme is later adopted by both
Peirce, and Vygotsky, and it also finds echoes in the contemporary work of
John McDowell. The latter argues, in his ‘Mind and World’, that “we must insist
that the understanding is already inextricably implicated in the deliverances of
sensibility themselves. Experiences are impressions made by the world on our
senses, products of receptivity; but those impressions themselves already have
conceptual content” (McDowell 1994: 46). This neo-Hegelian way of thinking
about concepts undermines the framework of ‘secondary dualism’ which insists
upon the separation of the conceptual and the perceptual. Indeed, McDowell
highlights the “unboundedness of the conceptual” (McDowell 1994: 24–45).12
12 Brandom also seeks to revise the location of the barrier between the sensible and the conceptual. He adopts an approach which he calls ‘inferentialism’ and he claims that any concept
necessarily involves inferences about the world. This means that a concept entails “the giving
and asking of reasons” (Brandom 2000: 10–11):
The master idea that animates and orients this enterprise is that what distinguishes specifically discursive practices from the doings of non-concept-using creatures is their inferential articulation. To talk about concepts is to talk about roles in reasoning. . . [The
master idea] is a rationalist pragmatism, in giving pride of place to practices of giving and
asking for reasons, understanding them as conferring conceptual content on performances, expressions, and states suitably caught up in those practices.
This brings Brandom closer to Peirce, but Brandom departs from him by arguing that this
“giving and asking of reasons” is social in nature (Brandom 2000: 163):
The thesis to be elaborated here is that the representational dimension of discourse reflects the fact that conceptual content is not only inferentially articulated but also socially
articulated. The game of giving and asking for reasons is an essentially social practice.

48

3 Hegel, Peirce, and Vygotsky: Models of perception

One of the effects of Hegel’s position, combining the perceptual and the conceptual, is that it now becomes possible to talk of the mind’s ability to experience
its own concepts. They are no longer just secondary auxiliaries to received sense
data. Indeed, Hegel’s treatment of perception means that concepts, once formed,
can be used to inform subsequent experience; the mind thus encounters the
world through its concepts. This same approach will also be found in Peirce and
Vygotsky; Peirce, for example, argues that the human intellect creates ‘thirds’
through its signs and that, once formed, these signs can be perceived in the
world. Equally, Vygotsky suggests that the mind experiences reality through its
‘verbalised perceptions’. In this, they are both following Hegel who argues that
“Man, therefore, is always thinking, even in his perceptions” (Hegel 2014: 29).

3.2 Peirce on perception
In line with Hegel, Peirce begins his analysis of concept formation with a critique
of human perception. It is of some note that Peirce’s analysis of perception is a
subject that seldom concerns semioticians. Armed with an assumption that they
already know the identity of the ‘sign vehicle’, they tend to marginalise this aspect
of his work and so gloss over the very foundations of his sign theory. Almeder,
notes, for example, that a feature of contemporary Peircean exegesis is the lack of
an adequate discussion of his views on perception (Almeder 1980: 137).
In analysing Peirce’s views on perception, it is important to begin with Peirce’s
rejection of nominalism. Peirce is a fervent critic of this philosophical tradition
(Forster 2011) and, like John Deely a century after him, he seeks to develop his philosophy by effectively “rooting out nominalism” (Cobley 2009: 6). The nominalist
stance, Peirce argues, largely determines the framework through which modernity
views the world, “but it is not modern philosophers only who are nominalists. The
nominalist Weltanschauung has become incorporated into what I will venture to
call the very flesh and blood of the average modern mind” (EP2: 157).
As noted earlier, nominalism is closely related to ‘secondary dualism’; it
adopts a similar stance on meaning construction and it embraces the atomisation
of sense data. Consequently, as soon as an identity is given to a particular sense
datum, it is isolated from its companions. Peirce rejects both this philosophical
position and its consequences. At one point (EP1: 104) he states that “if the nominalistic character of these doctrines themselves cannot be detected, it will at

least be admitted that they are observed to carry along with them those daughters of nominalism, – sensationalism, phenomenalism, individualism, and materialism”. In the context of this essay, these “daughters of nominalism” require
evaluation. Such an analysis will illustrate the full extent to which Peirce concurs
with our earlier critique of ‘secondary dualism’.
When Peirce mentions “individualism” he is referring to the atomisation of
sense data. Peirce rejects this notion and, instead, argues that the human mind
can only experience the world as a continuum which he terms the “Phaneron”
(EP2: 362). The intellect encounters the world as a continuous flow of experience. Peirce argues, as a result, that acts of perception involve the selection of
phenomena from this continuum and that such sense data come embedded with
inferential links to other perceptions. This means that the mind never perceives
an individuated sense datum which is isolated from others. Peirce states, for example, that “continuity is given in perception” (EP2: 238), and he maintains that
philosophers should think in terms of “synechism, or the doctrine that all that
exists is continuous” (CP1: 172). Importantly, it also follows from this that the
human mind is part of this continuity itself. It cannot stand back and view reality from the ‘outside’ as if it were a ‘spectator’. Indeed, Peirce insists the intellect
is immersed in experience and that “we ought to say that we are in signs and
not that signs are in us” (CP5: 289).
As discussed, the atomisation of human sense data also entails the fact
that perceptions are exhausted by their individual qualities. The mind can experience a red sense datum, or a blue sense datum, but it cannot observe a
sense datum which is simultaneously red and blue. Peirce also rejects this conclusion as another consequence of ‘individualism’. Instead, he argues that a
particular sense datum can include multiple qualities which can be subsequently separated by the mind. Crucially, this allows him to maintain that the
human intellect perceives connections in the world because its sense data are
experienced as perceptual bundles.
Secondly, Peirce highlights “sensationalism” – his equivalent of the ‘Myth
of the Given’. Concurring with Hegel and Sellars, Peirce argues that the mind
cannot possess certain perceptual knowledge and so he rejects the ‘intuitionism’ of Kant (EP1: 12–27; CP5: 213). Indeed, Peirce maintains that the mind only
experiences perceptual ‘vagues’ which are always open to further determination. However, such analysis should avoid the conclusion that Peirce also rejects the idea that the mind directly experiences its sense data. Peirce, in fact,
insists that the mind does possess such immediate experience. So, Peirce, following Hegel, espouses a very distinct philosophical position; he claims that
the intellect does not know the precise identity of its sense data, but, at the
same time, it has direct access to them.

50

3 Hegel, Peirce, and Vygotsky: Models of perception

This leaves two further “daughters of nominalism” – “materialism” and
“phenomenalism”. These terms are both aligned to Peirce’s rejection of dualism.
Peirce states, as noted earlier, that “the old dualistic notion of mind and matter,
so prominent in Cartesianism, as two radically different kinds of substance, will
hardly find defenders today. Rejecting this, we are driven to some kind of hylopathy, otherwise called monism” (EP1: 292). The notion of ‘matter’, as one of the
two poles of dualism, is entailed in his rejection of “materialism”. Surprisingly,
however, Peirce also rejects ‘phenomenalism’ at the other pole. This is important
because modern accounts of perception often assume that a rejection of ‘materialism’ must involve a form of ‘phenomenalism’. But Peirce seeks to establish a
middle ground where neither materialism nor phenomenalism hold their sway.
And it is a position which opens the possibility of synthetic human knowledge. It
is what Peirce refers to when he cites the notion of “monism”.
At this point, it is important to discuss Hegel’s own phenomenology. This is
quite different from the phenomenological theories often found in the twentieth
century. The latter often involve notions of individual, or social, constructions
of the world which float free from reality. Hegel, however, is aware of this alternative form of phenomenology and, over a century before social constructivism
emerges on the philosophical scene, he warns (Hegel 2014: 239) of the dangers
that it entails:
The abuses which these methods with their formalism once led to in philosophy and science
have in modern times been followed by the abuses of what is called ‘Construction’. . . . .
The name ‘Construction of notions’ has since been given to a sketch or statement of sensible
attributes which were picked up from perception, quite guiltless of any influence of the notion, and to the additional formalism of classifying scientific and philosophical objects in a
tabular form on some presupposed rubric, but in other respects at the fancy and discretion
of the observer.

Having identified the key aspects of nominalism which Peirce rejects, it is now
important to consider his own position on perception. At the very foundation of
his own account is the notion of the ‘percept’. This perceptual entity is quite
different from the atomised ‘sensation’ of the nominalist model. Peirce describes the percept as follows (CP7: 619):
Let us say that, as I sit here writing, I see on the other side of my table, a yellow chair
with a green cushion. That will be what psychologists term a ‘percept’ (res percepta).
They also frequently call it an ‘image’. With this term I shall pick no quarrel. Only one
must be on one’s guard against a false impression that it might insinuate. Namely, an
‘image’ usually means something intended to represent, – virtually professing to represent – something else, real or ideal. So understood, the word ‘image’ would be a misnomer for a percept. The chair I appear to see makes no professions of any kind, essentially
embodies no intentions of any kind, does not stand for anything. It obtrudes itself upon

3.2 Peirce on perception

51

my gaze; but not as a deputy for anything else, not ‘as’ anything. It simply knocks at the
portal of my soul and stands there in the doorway.

Several points emerge in this passage. Firstly, Peirce insists that the percept does
not “stand for” anything. It is not a representation of something that might, or
might not, exist ‘behind’ it. Secondly, the percept, as a whole, acts upon the perceiver. Peirce argues that it “obtrudes itself upon my gaze”. This reverses the position of ‘secondary dualism’ which views the perceiver as an active agency
which inspects its atomised perceptions. And thirdly, for Peirce, percepts are always perceived as connected to one another (CP7: 624):
The psychologists very reasonably argue that the first impressions made upon sense must
have been feelings of sense qualities – say colours, sounds, etc – disconnected from one
another, and not appearing to stand over against a self as objects . . . . But this is quite
inferential. We are, of course, directly aware of positive sense-qualities in the percept (although in the percept itself they are in no wise separate from the whole object); but as for
their being at first disconnected and not objectified; that is psychological theory.

And it follows from this position that percepts are not exhausted by one quality.
When I see a chair, for example, my mind also perceives the different elements
of it connected to each other. Leaving aside Peirce’s reference below to ‘firstness’,
he states that (CP7: 625):
In the percept, these elements of Firstness are perceived to be connected in definite ways.
A visual percept of a chair has a definite shape. If it is yellow, with a green cushion, that
is quite different from being green with a yellow cushion. These connectives are directly
perceived, and the perception of each of them is a perception at once of two opposed objects, – a double awareness. In respect to each of these connections, one part of the percept appears as it does relatively to a second part.

The chair is thus experienced in its entirety and we are aware of the relationships
between its perceptual elements. This position is not open to the nominalist who
can only link atomised perceptions through interpretation.
The ‘percept’ is, however, only one part of Peirce’s theory of perception. He
goes on to argue that percepts are transformed by the human mind in ‘perceptual
judgments’. The latter allows the intellect to make a transition from a ‘dumb’ percept to the beginnings of human knowledge. The ‘perceptual judgement’ is,
therefore, critical to Peirce because it allows him, following Hegel, to combine
both the perceptual and the conceptual. Peirce states that “the moment we fix
our minds upon it and think the least thing about the percept, it is the perceptual
judgment that tells us what we so ‘perceive’” (CP7: 643). Rosenthal (2004: 194)
emphasises this important point:

52

3 Hegel, Peirce, and Vygotsky: Models of perception

The percept is that sensory element which is presented in perceptual awareness . . . . . .
Peirce is not here asserting that we first perceive the percept and then proceed to interpret
it in a judgment. Nor is he asserting that the percept and the content of the perceptual
judgment are physically, metaphysically, or numerically distinct. He does not hold that
what we are aware of is sense data of some sort rather than a physical object. Rather, the
percept as interpreted is what we immediately perceive and is the reality.

The ‘perceptual judgment’, therefore, spontaneously tells the perceiver what
sort of thing the percept is. In doing so, the ‘perceptual judgement’ changes the
epistemological status of the perception; it becomes a ‘judgment’ (EP2: 155):
By a perceptual judgment, I mean a judgment asserting in propositional form what a character of a percept directly present to the mind is. The percept of course is not itself a judgment, nor can a judgment in any degree resemble a percept. It is as unlike it as the printed
letters in a book where a Madonna of Murillo is described are unlike the picture itself.

This means that, for Peirce, the human intellect experiences reality through its
‘perceptual judgments’. It does not experience individual things as such. Instead, the mind perceives elements of reality, potentially, as members of a
class. And, as a result, ‘perceptual judgments’ subsume particulars under possible universals. Gallie (1952: 67) confirms this, stating that Peirce “rejects the
claim that we have direct intuitive knowledge of such elementary data on the
ground that whenever we know something, we know it as something – as being
of such and such a character, or as standing in such and such relations. In otherwords, to know something, we must classify it, or relate it”. Peirce’s account,
therefore, introduces a form of classificatory knowledge into human perceptual
acts. A ‘perceptual judgment’ classifies a percept and says what sort of thing it
might be. Critically, for Peirce, this process is beyond the control of the perceiver. It is not the same as the interpreting mind standing back and inspecting
its sense data. In contrast, Peirce insists that the perceptual judgment “compels
assent” (CP7: 627).
Importantly, ‘perceptual judgments’ classify percepts through spontaneous
acts of comparison. Peirce states that (CP7: 632):
But the perceptual judgment ‘This chair appears yellow’ has vaguely in mind a whole lot
of yellow things, of which some have been seen, and no end of others may be or might be
seen; and what it means to say is, ‘Take any yellow thing you like, and you will find, on
comparing it with this chair, that they agree pretty well in colour’.

This means that the ‘perceptual judgment’, as an initial form of knowledge,
forms a tentative proposition (Stjernfelt 2014: 5). It makes the hypothetical assertion that percept ‘y’ may be a member of class ‘x’. Peirce readily accepts that
such perceptual judgments may be indeterminate, or even incorrect, but this
does not change the underlying structure of the perceptual judgment itself. As

3.2 Peirce on perception

53

Forster argues, on Peirce’s definition, “a perceptual judgment qualifies as a judgment because it involves assent to a proposition” (Forster 2011: 121). Concurring
with Hegel and McDowell, Peirce thus asserts that the conceptual is intrinsically
involved in the perceptual.
Peirce’s insistence that ‘perceptual judgments’ may be mistaken underpins
another of his doctrines. The idea of ‘fallibilism’ argues that a perceptual judgement classifies a percept in such a way that is always open to revision (Short
2007: 317–323). For example, if I see a blue stain out of the corner of my eye,
then this is what I have classified it as at that moment. If I realise, however,
that it is, in fact, some blue paper, then this second ‘perceptual judgment’ does
not falsify the original one; it simply replaces it. Peirce, therefore, describes fallibilism in these terms: “For fallibilism is the doctrine that our knowledge is
never absolute but always swims, as it were, in a continuum of uncertainty and
of indeterminacy” (CP1: 171).
This indeterminacy reinforces the view that the mind can only experience
perceptual ‘vagues’. Thus, when I see what I think is a ‘blue stain’, what I observe is a member of a putative class; it is the sort of thing that looks like a ‘blue
stain’ to me. Peirce is adamant that I do not know that this percept is of a specific blue stain (i.e., a singular fact about reality). All that I know is that the
stain looks like it belongs to the class of things that look like blue stains. This
explains why Peirce invokes the terminology of ‘vagues’ – they are never absolutely true, or false; they simply have the potential, as a class, to be further
determined.
It is important, also, to emphasise that Peirce’s perceptual ‘vagues’ are
forms of hypothesis.13 Gallie (1952: 68–69) maintains that:
This brings us to Peirce’s own, at first sight, paradoxical suggestion that every piece of
apparently direct intuitive knowledge – including our knowledge of the most elementary
‘data of consciousness’ – is in fact of the nature of a hypothesis; since every claim to
knowledge involves the assumption that a certain method of classification or systematization will in fact apply to a particular object or set of objects in a particular way.

This philosophical position has considerable implications for Peirce’s semiotics.
It means that the intellect cannot know the identity of a ‘sign vehicle’. Indeed,
in Peircean semiotics, a perception simply forms the vague starting point of a
sign (e.g., a representamen). As such, it becomes clear that the central thrust of

13 This aspect of the ‘perceptual judgment’ leads to Peirce’s arguments for abduction – discussed in section 13.3.

54

3 Hegel, Peirce, and Vygotsky: Models of perception

Peirce’s semiotics is to show how the mind moves from its perceptual ‘vagues’
to more determinate concepts through the action of signs.14
There are several implications of this analysis for Peirce’s treatment of universals. Because the ‘perceptual judgment’ creates a member of a potential class
it also implicitly forms a putative universal (or ‘general’ as Peirce calls it). He argues, for example, that “it follows that since no cognition of ours is absolutely
determinate, generals must have a real existence. Now this scholastic realism is
usually set down as a belief in metaphysical fictions” (CP5: 312). Such an account
of the universal is, of course, contrary to ‘secondary dualism’ which asserts that
the mind perceives atomised particulars and creates universals from them. In
contrast to this, Peirce argues that the intellect directly experiences universals
(albeit as perceptual vagues) in its ‘perceptual judgments’. This has the effect of
radically changing the way the human intellect relates to its perceptions. The
secondary dualist contends that knowledge moves from particulars to universals.
Peirce, on the other hand, argues that the mind perceives things as members of
classes and that the mind subsequently determines further specifications of
them. Peirce notes above that his position is often mistakenly viewed as a form
of metaphysics. But Boler explains Peirce’s position and insists that “in its strictly
logical sense, the universal is a creation of the mind and cannot exist apart from
the mind. But it is not necessarily a fiction, for it can be based on a real commonness which is the nature in itself” (Boler 1963: 52).
This is not to claim, of course, that Peirce completely rejects the notion of
individuality. Early in his career he did seem to adopt this more radical position
(CP3: 93). However, in later years, Peirce accepts that the mind experiences
individuality through “haecceity” (Murphey 1993: 131). But this position does
not detract from Peirce’s consistent rejection of the view that perception begins
with atomised sense data.

14 There are interesting parallels between Merleau-Ponty and Peirce’s account of perception.
The former also refutes the ‘sideways’ account of cognition implicit in ‘secondary dualism’
and maintains that reality is experienced through indeterminate sense impressions (MerleauPonty 2012: 5):
We are caught up in the world and we do not succeed in detaching ourselves from it in
order to shift to the consciousness of the world. If we were to do so, we would see that the
quality is never directly experienced, and that all consciousness is consciousness of
something. This ‘something’, moreover, is not necessarily an identifiable object. There
are two ways of being mistaken regarding quality: the first is to turn it into an element of
consciousness when it is in fact an object for consciousness, to treat it as a mute impression when it in fact always has a sense; the second is to believe that this sense and this
object, at the level of quality, are full and determinate.

3.3 Vygotsky on perception

55

As an overall philosophical stance, however, this still leaves Peirce with
the requirement to find a way for the human mind to “fix belief” within the perceptual continuum of his ‘synechism’ (EP1: 109–123). In the case of Hegel, this
perceptual indeterminacy is tackled through the logical workings of dialecticism. For Peirce, however, this cognitive task is achieved through the combinatory actions of signs. This is the central purpose of his semiotics and will be
discussed in due course.

3.3 Vygotsky on perception
Vygotsky also maintains, like Peirce, that the mind’s initial experiences of the
world are ‘indeterminate’. This is, again, evidence of Vygotsky’s Hegelian influence. He describes a child’s sense data, for example, as “a wild dance of uncoordinated sensations” (Vygotsky 1987: 291). And when describing a scenario in
which a child is confronted with an intellectual puzzle, Vygotsky, and Luria
(1994: 117) talk of the confused nature of the child’s responses: “The small
child, placed in a situation where the direct attainment of his purpose seems
impossible, displays a very complex activity which can only be described as a
jumbled mixture of direct attempts to obtain the desired end . . . .”
Overall, however, Vygotsky places much less emphasis on the indeterminacy of perception than do either Hegel or Peirce. This is largely because he is
writing as a psychologist rather than a philosopher. But, at the same time, it is
also evident that he adopts the same starting point for concept formation, including the idea that the mind experiences reality as a continuum. Vygotsky
claims, for example, that a “child’s thought emerges first in a fused, unpartitioned whole” (Vygotsky 1987: 251) and elsewhere he states (Vygotsky 1987:
298) that “structural psychology has shown that the small child does not perceive separate objects. Daily observation supports this perspective. Whether the
situation is that of play or feeding, the child perceives the whole situation”.
And Vygotsky and Luria (1994: 127) also confirm the same point when they suggest that “in processes of so-called ‘immediate perception’ and the transmission
of perceived forms uninfluenced by speech, the child grasps and fixes an impression of the whole (spots of colour, the basic features of form, etc)”.
Confronted with the perceptual continuum, Peirce believes the mind creates its initial classifications through ‘perceptual judgments’. Vygotsky does
not adopt this solution, but he still maintains that perceptual categorisation
takes place. With Luria, he states that (Vygotsky and Luria 1994: 127):

56

3 Hegel, Peirce, and Vygotsky: Models of perception

Yet no matter how correctly and skilfully the child does it, at the very first stages of
speech its perception ceases to be bound by the immediate impression of the whole; in its
field of vision there arise new centres, fixed by words, and ties appear between these
centres and different parts of the situation being perceived; perception ceases to be a
‘slave’ of the field of vision and, independently of the degree of correctness and perfection of solution, the child transmits impressions transformed by words.

Vygotsky and Luria thus assert that the intellect creates “centres” of perception
and that this involves an element of “fixing”. But what is different, in their account, is that this activity takes place using words. Linask observes that, for Vygotsky, “perception is no longer only an observation of some shape or colour –
it is not isolated, but categorized. In a way, humans perceive with the aid of
speech” (Linask 2019: 280). And this position is also reflected in Vygotsky’s
treatment of attention in a child. It is the use of words that allows a child to
focus on specific aspects of the ‘visual field’ (Vygotsky and Luria 1994: 125):
From the first steps of the child’s development, the word intrudes into the child’s perception, singling out separate elements overcoming the natural structure of the sensory field
and, as it were, forming new (artificially introduced and mobile) structural centres.
Speech does not merely accompany the child’s perception, from the very first it begins to
take an active part in it: the child begins to perceive the world not only through its eyes,
but also through its speech, and it is in this process that we find an essential point in the
development of the child’s perception.

Vygotsky thus envisages an ascent from what he calls “natural perceptions” to
the “higher forms of perception” which are specifically human. For him, words
are central to this process as they help a child to single out perceptions and so
create “verbalised perceptions”. In other words, the child begins to see the
world through these higher-level perceptions as informed by words. Vygotsky
states that “what was usually regarded as a property of the child’s natural perception, proved to be really a peculiarity of its speech, or, in other words, a peculiarity of its verbalised perception” (Vygotsky and Luria 1994: 125). However,
these new forms of perception do not entirely replace ‘natural perceptions’. Instead, they establish a new level of perceptual experience above them and, as
such, ‘verbalised perceptions’ enable the child to restructure its world. Vygotsky thus argues that “at the moment when, thanks to the planning assistance
of speech, a view of the future is included as an active agent, the child’s whole
operational psychological field changes radically and its behaviour is fundamentally reconstructed. The child’s perception begins to develop according to
new laws that differ from those of the natural optic field” (Vygotsky and Luria
1994: 122).
Vygotsky’s notion of ‘verbalised perceptions’ exhibits clear parallels with
way in which Hegel, and Peirce, fuse the perceptual and the conceptual. The

3.3 Vygotsky on perception

57

human mind sees the world, as Vygotsky puts it, with ‘sense and meaning’ in a
passage which Peirce himself could have written (Vygotsky 1978: 33):
A special feature of human perception – which arises at a very young age – is the perception
of real objects. This is something for which there is no analogy in animal perception. By this
term I mean that I do not see the world simply in colour and shape but also as a world with
sense and meaning. I do not merely see something round and black with two hands; I see a
clock and I can distinguish one hand from the other. . . . . These observations suggest that
all human perception consists of categorised rather than isolated perceptions.

And echoing our earlier critique of ‘secondary dualism’, Vygotsky insists that
the mind cannot separate its perceptions from its concepts; perceptions (if they
are not simply ‘natural’) must inherently contain conceptual meaning (Vygotsky 1987: 295–296):
Another [issue] is the meaningful nature of our perception. It has been shown experimentally
that we cannot create conditions that will functionally separate our perception from meaningful interpretation of the perceived object . . . The understanding of the thing, the name of
the object, is given together with its perception . . . . . . I see the object. I immediately perceive the object as such, with all of its meaning and sense. I see a lamp, a table, a person, or
a door. In Buhler’s words my perception is an inseparable part of my concrete thinking.

Vygotsky’s contention that perceptions are picked out from an experiential continuum also has consequences for his views on the contemporary psychology of
his time. Vygotsky’s rejection of ‘atomism’ leads him to attack what he calls the
mindset of ‘associationism’ dominant in the psychology of the early twentieth
century. This assumes that human knowledge is created by establishing ‘links’
between sense data. Vygotsky (1987: 291) critiques this thinking in the following terms: “[In the Associationist view] the child’s mental development consists
of the constant accumulation of this material, resulting in new, more extended,
and richer associative connections among separate objects. The child’s perception is constructed and grows with this development of associative connections”. In contrast to this approach, Vygotsky sees mental development as a
qualitative development which involves the constant formation of new concepts, new identities, and new structures. Concepts are not formed, as a result,
by creating links or associations in the mind (Vygotsky 1994: 259):
A concept is not just an enriched and internally joined associative group. It represents a
qualitatively new phenomenon which cannot be reduced to more elementary processes
which are characteristic of the early stages of development in the intellect. Concept thinking
is a new form of intellectual activity, a new mode of conduct, a new intellectual mechanism.

As an aside, this rejection of ‘associationism’ is also evident in Hegel. He states,
rather acerbically, and referring to British empiricism, that “the so-called laws

58

3 Hegel, Peirce, and Vygotsky: Models of perception

of the association of ideas were objects of great interest, especially during the
outburst of empirical psychology which was contemporaneous with the decline
of philosophy” (Hegel [1830] 1894: 455).
For Vygotsky, however, it is the mind’s ability to create new concepts which
liberates the human mind from the mechanistic thought of animals. By creating
concepts, and developing ‘higher psychological processes’, the intellect frees itself from the rigid constraints of ‘natural perception’ (Vygotsky 1978: 35):
However, the difference between the practical intelligence of children and animals is that
children are capable of reconstructing their perception and thus freeing themselves from
the given structure of the field. With the help of the indicative function of words, the child
begins to master attention, creating new structural centers in the perceived situation.

These processes ensure that humans are not slaves to their vision (Vygotsky
1987: 127) and, as a result, they are able to develop choice in the world. Moreover,
Vygotsky’s rejection of ‘associationism’ also means that the workings of the
human mind cannot be understood by psychology itself in simplistic models of
‘stimulus and response’ (Vygotsky 1978: 58):
Despite great diversity in procedural details, virtually all psychological experiments rely
on what we shall term a stimulus-response framework. By this we mean that no matter
what psychological process is under discussion, the psychologist seeks to confront the
subject with some kind of stimulus situation designed to influence him in a particular
way, and then the psychologist examines and analyses the response(s) elicited by that
stimulating situation.

Because human perception, however, works at a higher level, Vygotsky argues
that such stimulus and response approaches are bound to fail. He contends
that “when we examine the experimental procedures used in complex reactions, we find that all are restricted to meaningless connections between stimuli
and responses” (Vygotsky 1978: 69). And Vygotsky suggests that the psychology of his time has also fallen into other dualistic traps. One of the most important of these is the assumption that the mind and body exist in separate realms.
When discussing the differences between the historical and the biological development in a child, Vygotsky (1994: 197) argues that:
So, a great chasm continues to gape between these two concepts. The historical and the
biological aspect of the child’s development end up separated from one another and it is
impossible to build a bridge of any sort between them, which might help us unite facts
and data pertaining to the dynamics of form in the thinking process with the facts or data
about the dynamics of the content which fills this form.

Elsewhere, Vygotsky also insists that other dualisms impede the progress of
psychology. He argues that speech is often treated, quite incorrectly, as an

3.3 Vygotsky on perception

59

external manifestation of internal thought. As such, it is viewed as an accompaniment of thought, rather than something that actively informs it. This results
in yet another dualism being created – that between sound and meaning. If
speech is treated merely as the outward expression of inner thoughts, then the
sounds contained within it are separated from their meanings and they simply
correspond, once more, by association. Vygotsky attacks this dualistic assumption when he states that “in accordance with dominant trend, psychology has
until recently depicted the matter in an oversimplified way. It was assumed
that the means of communication was a sign (the word or sound); that through
simultaneous occurrence a sound could become associated with the content of
any experience and then serve to convey the same content to other human
beings” (Vygotsky 2012: 7–8). This approach is seriously undermined by Vygotsky’s insistence on the verbal origins of human concepts.
Overall, therefore, despite some important variations in approach, it is evident that parallels exist between Peirce and Vygotsky in their accounts of perception, and, furthermore, that these similarities derive from their shared Hegelian
heritage. All three thinkers reject the core tenets of ‘secondary dualism’ and the
philosophical difficulties that stem from it. Moreover, all three acknowledge the
indeterminacy of human perception and believe that their main philosophical
task is to explain how the mind moves from this indeterminacy to form its higher
concepts. They agree that this must involve some way of ‘fixing’ this perceptual
indeterminacy. It has already been highlighted above that Vygotsky believes that
words have a critical role in this activity. But it is also important to assess how
Hegel tackled this philosophical problem and how he originally accounted for
concept formation. Hegel’s own solution involves the invocation of a mediating
entity (an ‘Essence’) created by the mind itself. This idea is subsequently developed by Peirce (and by Vygotsky) in their respective explanations of how the
human mind creates stable and effective concepts. We will now turn to a discussion of the role of mediation in Hegel, Peirce, and Vygotsky.

Part Two: Concept formation as mediation

4 Hegel’s template of concept formation
To support the claim that Peirce and Vygotsky are influenced by the Hegelian
account of concept development, it is clearly important to articulate the contours of Hegel’s original model. The purpose of this chapter is, therefore, to
show how Hegel outlines how conceptual development begins with the mind’s
indeterminate perceptions. This discussion will introduce one of the main
themes of this essay – the role of mediation in concept formation. This is a central feature of Hegel’s model, and it also enjoys pivotal importance in Peirce
and Vygotsky. Understanding Hegel’s account of mediation is, therefore, critical. This is especially the case given that this is precisely where Peirce and Vygotsky are most frequently misconstrued by modern commentators.
Given the intrinsic weaknesses of ‘secondary dualism’, the current author
has much sympathy with the Hegelian perspective on cognition. But it is also
important to state that Hegel’s broader mistake was to take this quite persuasive model of human knowledge and to extend it into his theories of history
and of the state. None of these Hegelian pathways need to deflect us here; it is
entirely possible to isolate his understanding of human cognition. Indeed, both
Peirce and Vygotsky demonstrate that this is possible without venturing into
the more controversial areas of Hegelian thought.
But before starting an analysis of Hegel’s own position, it is also worthwhile
briefly outlining some of the historical background to his thought. In particular,
it is useful to highlight the influence on Hegel of both Spinoza and Leibniz. This
is the case, not only because it elucidates aspects of Hegel’s thought, but because
Peirce was very familiar with Leibniz, and Vygotsky with Spinoza.

4.1 Background: Spinoza and Leibniz
Both Spinoza and Leibniz were influential in the history of German Idealism.
When Hegel sought to reject the new direction in which Kant had taken European philosophy it was to these two philosophers that he often turned. These
were not, of course, the only influences on Hegel and several other philosophers, in the early years of German Idealism, also played a significant role in
the development of his thought. These were, for example, Maimon,15 Fichte,

15 Salomon Maimon ([1790] 2010), a Lithuanian contemporary of Kant, is one of the first philosophers to reject the consequences of Kant’s position – including his intuitionism and his

and Schelling.16 However, Spinoza and Leibniz were influential for Hegel because they provided a critique of the more damaging consequences of Kantian
philosophy. And they also offered an account of reality that was both nondualistic and relational in nature. This appealed to Hegel as he sought to establish a new platform for human knowledge.
Spinoza is, fundamentally, a ‘monist’ (Spinoza [1677] 1996: 71) and this is a
term that has already been noted in Peirce. When Spinoza talks about the
‘world’, he is not discussing an objective ‘reality’ in the modern sense. What he
is describing is a relational structure that is neither ‘objective’ nor ‘subjective’ in
nature. Indeed, it makes no sense to think about Spinoza’s concept of ‘reality’ in
these modern terms – for they only came to have their current meanings in the
centuries after his death.17 In contrast to the modern stance, Spinoza construes

division of reality into the phenomenal and the noumenal. Many of Maimon’s views came
down to Hegel through the work of Fichte and Schelling.
16 The scope of this essay does not permit a full analysis of the influence of Schelling on
Peirce, but they have already been highlighted by semioticians such Ivo Ibri (2014). Even a
cursory reading of Schelling’s ‘System of Transcendental Idealism’, however, provides many
examples of such influence. These include: a rejection of dualism (Schelling 1978: 5–11), the
notions of ‘positing’ (Schelling 1978: 37), determination (Schelling 1978: 10), mediation (Schelling 1978: 15), schemas (Schelling 1978: 137), secondness or limitation (Schelling 1978: 56), the
existence of ‘thirds’ (Schelling 1978: 89), sublation (Schelling 1978: 126), the nature of matter
(Schelling 1978: 92), the interplay of form and content (Schelling 1978: 19–20), and the threestage structure of concept formation (his first, second and third ‘epochs’) (Schelling 1978:
51–151). All these concepts, formed within the tradition of German Idealism, are developed by
Hegel, and adopted by Peirce. They will be discussed, in a Peircean context, in this essay. Ibri
(2014: 39) also suggests that Schelling’s advocacy of ‘objective idealism’ pre-dates Peirce’s
own position on the nature of reality.
Arran Gare also picks up on the links between Peirce and Schelling (Gare 2019: 38). His
paper on biosemiotics highlights that not all causation is mechanistic (Gare 2019: 37), and that
Peirce gives a role to ‘final causes’ in his philosophy. Gare also insists that reality is relational
(Gare 2019: 49) and that, as a result, human knowledge has anticipatory features (Gare 2019:
47). He departs, however, from the account, given in this essay, of semiosis and views it as a
form of causation (Gare 2019: 38) based on the interpretation of signs (Gare 2019: 42).
17 The terms ‘objective’ and ‘subjective’ have almost entirely opposite meanings in premodern and early modern philosophy when compared with modern usage. The Oxford English
Dictionary, for example, states that “scholastic philosophy made the distinction between what
belongs to things subjectively, or as they are ‘in themselves’, and what belongs to them objectively, as they are presented to the consciousness. In later times the custom of considering the
perceiving or thinking consciousness as pre-eminently ‘the subject’ brought about a different
use of these words, which now prevails in philosophical language. According to this, what is
considered as belonging to the perceiving or thinking self is called subjective and what is considered as independent of the perceiving or thinking self is called, in contrast, objective” (Oxford English Dictionary 1989: Vol X: 643). This construal is also confirmed by Deely (2009: 17),

4.1 Background: Spinoza and Leibniz

‘reality’ as a single structure that is known by God, but which is potentially
knowable (at least partially) by the human mind. It is tempting, of course, to
view such an account of reality in strictly metaphysical terms, but this is an effect of the widespread modern assumption that objective reality must exist ‘behind’, or ‘beyond’, human perception. Spinoza, however, would not subscribe
to this latter proposition.
Spinoza views reality as relational and this has implications for his treatment of human knowledge. He argues that when the mind encounters something, it only perceives what it is partially because it only experiences some of
the relational connections that it possesses with the rest of the universe. As a
result, the intellect can never know the entire nature of something, because to
do so would entail knowing all these relational connections. Human knowledge, therefore, always begins as a series of “confused ideas’” (Spinoza 1996:
51). As was noted above, this idea has already been encountered in Hegel’s and
Peirce’s notion of perceptual ‘indeterminacy’.
In this context, Spinoza makes an important distinction between ‘adequate’
and ‘inadequate ideas’ (Spinoza 1996: 69). The former represents a form of
knowledge where the mind knows enough of the empirical connections of an
object to understand what it entails. An ‘inadequate idea’, in contrast, is one
where this clarity of thought is yet to be achieved. Understanding the true nature of an object is determined, as a result, by gradually comprehending an object’s relationships with the world. When the mind has developed such an
understanding of an object, such comprehension acts as an ‘instrument’, or
mental ‘tool’ (Spinoza 1955: 12). This is because the concept now contains an
understanding of how an object will behave in the future – a conclusion that
will be encountered again in Peirce’s pragmatism.
As the mind’s knowledge of the world becomes more and more extensive,
Spinoza argues that links are established between ‘adequate ideas’; they begin
to form a whole. The growth of human knowledge is thus depicted as an evolutionary process in which human understanding builds incrementally. This is
another theme that has parallels in Hegel, Peirce, and Vygotsky. They view

who argues that, in the pre-modern period, the term ‘subject’ meant “what is ‘brought under’
existence in its own right, what is cut off from the rest of the universe as an individual existent, a ‘subject of existence’, a substance – that ‘to which existence primarily comes, that
which exists ‘in itself’ as a being in its own right, rather than ‘in another’ as a modification of
a being in its own right, as a characteristic of an individual”. In other words, there is almost a
complete reversal of meanings taking place here; a ‘subject’, to the pre-moderns, had similarities with what modernity now calls an ‘object’.

66

4 Hegel’s template of concept formation

human knowledge as something that follows an ascending pathway from indeterminate perceptions to more clearly defined concepts.
In Leibniz, similar views can be found on the nature of reality and of human
knowledge. Leibniz rejects Cartesian Dualism and construes the universe as being
relational in nature. Where he differs from Spinoza, however, is in his rejection of
the latter’s ‘monism’. Whilst Spinoza argues that everything in the world is part of
one substance, Leibniz maintains that reality is a web of interrelating identities
which he calls ‘monads’. These, as will be seen later, have important similarities
with Hegel’s ‘Notions’. Monads are relational and the properties of each one is defined by its relationships with other monads (Leibniz [1714] 1951: 523). Individual
monads reflect, as a result, their overall position in the universe. Critically, these
identities are not created by human interpretation, as they are in the nominalistic
model. Instead, they constitute the structure of reality itself. Moreover, they have
no separate identity of their own, but are, instead, defined by the sum of their own
relationships. Critically, this means that they are not entities which first exist and
then have relationships with other monads. Instead, they are, themselves, defined
by their positions in the relational web of the universe.
For Hegel and Peirce, this Leibnizian framework is useful, but it needs to be
nuanced. They must explain how this web of being is created, but (unlike Leibniz)
they do not have recourse to God. And they each do this in a different way; Hegel
construes the human mind as positing ‘Essences’, which develop into ‘Notions’,
and become part of ‘The Absolute Idea’. In contrast, Peirce adopts a different
route and maintains that signs form identities which develop into symbols, and
then systems of symbols. In both cases, however, Hegel and Peirce retain Leibniz’s belief that the world is comprised of identities defined by their relationships
with each other. To illustrate Hegel’s stance, he talks, for example, of existence in
the following manner (Hegel 2014: 149):
Existence is the immediate unity of reflection-into-self and reflection-into-another. It follows from this that existence is the indefinite multitude of existents as reflected-intothemselves, which at the same time equally throw light upon one another, – which, in
short, are co-relative, and form a world of reciprocal dependence and of infinite interconnection between grounds and consequents.

And this can also be usefully compared with Leibniz’s description of monadic
relationships (Leibniz 1951: 523–524):
And as, because the world is a plenum, everything is connected and each body acts upon
every other body, more or less, according to the distance, and by reaction is itself affected
thereby, it follows that each monad is a living mirror, or endowed with internal activity,
representative according to its point of view of the universe, and as regulated as the universe itself.

4.1 Background: Spinoza and Leibniz

67

Hegel’s description of “unity of reflection-into-self and reflection into other”
thus echoes Leibniz’s earlier exposition. The main difference, however, is that
Leibnizian monads exist in the mind of God, whilst Hegel’s Notions are the partial creation of the human intellect.
Leibniz also inherits many of Spinoza’s views on human knowledge. He argues that only partial understanding of objects is possible and that human
knowledge, therefore, must admit of degrees. Leibniz agrees with Spinoza that
the mind possesses, initially, only ‘confused ideas’ and he concurs that these
gradually develop into ‘adequate ideas’. Leibniz, however, goes further; he
breaks the latter concept into two types of idea; ‘clear ideas’ and ‘distinct
ideas’.18 He maintains that when the human mind applies reason to the ‘confused’ ideas of perception, it first attains ‘clear ideas’: “I say, then, that an idea
is clear when it enables one to recognise the thing and distinguish it from other
things” (Leibniz [1704] 1996: 254). What defines a ‘clear idea’, therefore, is the
fact that the intellect can distinguish it from others. This is achieved through recognition because the mind senses that something is like something else.
The next stage in the development of human knowledge is the ‘distinct
idea’. When differentiating ‘clear’ from ‘distinct’ ideas, Leibniz (1996: 255) suggests that “they are clear, because we recognise them and easily tell them from
one another; but they are not distinct, because we cannot distinguish their contents”. What makes an idea ‘distinct’, therefore, is the fact that the mind can
now identify some of its contents. By this, Leibniz means that, when the mind
begins to know an object, it starts to understand its connections with the
world – both what is contained, and what is not contained, within the idea.19
18 Spinoza’s and Leibniz’s interpretations of ‘clear and distinct’ ideas are often overlooked in
the secondary literature on Peirce, but, in the early modern period, they formed a relatively
sophisticated means of understanding how human concepts develop. In the semiotic literature, if they are mentioned at all, they tend to be interpreted, however, along Cartesian lines.
Descartes’ interpretation of these two concepts is very different from that of Leibniz and Spinoza. Descartes wants to show how his ‘cogito’ acts as a platform for human knowledge and
how, as a result, it forms a guarantee of the mind’s ‘clear and distinct’ ideas. In this Cartesian
formulation, the latter begin to look like a form of ‘intuitionism’, when, in fact, in the hands of
Spinoza and Leibniz, they represent precisely opposite. ‘Clear and distinct’ ideas, from the perspective of Spinoza and Leibniz, are gradual steps in the evolution of human concepts and
knowledge.
19 Despite these convergences between Peirce and Leibniz, Peirce sometimes categorises Leibniz as a ‘nominalist’ (EP2: 157). On occasions, he even does the same with Hegel. Given that
both philosophers are deemed amongst the more ‘metaphysical’ thinkers in Western philosophy, this is a surprising claim. Peirce justifies his assertion, however, on the basis that both
Leibniz and Hegel lack his category of ‘secondness’ – something that will be discussed in due
course.

68

4 Hegel’s template of concept formation

Leibniz agrees with Spinoza that the goal of the mind should be to reach an
even higher level where it attains ‘perfect ideas’, but he accepts that only God
can achieve this. What is evident, however, is that Leibniz advocates a hierarchy of ideas and proposes that the human mind ascends from one level to the
next. This Leibnizian theme re-emerges in Hegel’s dialecticism, in Peirce’s sign
classification, and in Vygotsky’s description of how the “higher psychological
functions” are created.
Other aspects of Leibnizian thought also emerge in Peirce’s work. Leibniz
argues that an ‘adequate’ (but partial) idea of an object entails a ‘nominal definition’. However, when the mind knows more about an object, it begins to develop a ‘real definition’ of it. Of course, as with ‘perfect ideas’, the intellect
cannot achieve the perspective enjoyed by God (and know the entirety of a ‘real
definition’), but it can, at least, strive to improve upon its ‘nominal definitions’.
As will be noted later, Peirce adopts this Leibnizian framework in his account
of the ‘object’ in the sign when he makes a distinction between ‘immediate’ and
‘dynamic’ objects.20 This view is, again, based on a conceptual ascent taking
place within human knowledge (Barnham 2020: 116–120).
The model of the relational universe, adopted by Leibniz, can be outlined in
diagrammatical terms. In this model (Figure 2) a structure of interrelated identities
is depicted. Because these monadic identities are connected to each other, and are
defined by their inter-relationships, they form what Peirce calls a ‘synechistic’
model of reality that is both non-dualistic and continuous in nature (EP2: 1). Significantly, in this context, Leibniz views the human soul itself as being no more than
one monad amongst others in the universe. Of course, it has certain characteristics
that make it different from other monads – importantly it has consciousness – but
this feature does not detract from the fact that it is one monad immersed amongst
many. In such a system, there can be neither ‘subjective’, nor ‘objective’, stances,
and there can be no detached ‘spectator’ position.
This relational view of reality has often been highlighted by biosemioticians. They emphasise the universe’s complexity and that humans are part of a
biosemiotic “web of connections” (Wheeler 2006: 32). They also recognise that
this relational view of reality challenges the dualistic views of modern science
(Wheeler 2006: 53). But what they do not always acknowledge is that their

20 Whilst Peirce is aware of Leibniz’s separation of ‘confused’ and ‘distinct’ ideas, he will
have also encountered the same distinction in Duns Scotus. Aertsen (2012: 403–404) notes,
discussing Duns Scotus, that “in the order of origin, confused knowledge is prior to distinct
knowledge, since confused cognition takes an intermediary position between complete ignorance and distinct knowledge”. Peirce, therefore, was keenly aware of the philosophical history of this approach to human knowledge founded on an ascent through types of idea.

4.1 Background: Spinoza and Leibniz

69

relational model has quite different characteristics to that of Leibniz. Whilst biosemioticians claim that the world is made up of organisms connected by a web of
interpretative signs, Leibniz makes the far more radical claim that monads are, in
fact, real identities defined by their relationships with each other. This latter position is also held by Peirce, and it marks a significant point of divergence between
Peirce and modern biosemiotics. As will be seen, Peirce is closer to Leibniz’s account of a relational universe because his system establishes a web of semiotic
identities; he does not espouse a system of inter-connected interpretations.

Figure 2: Leibniz: A Relational Model of Reality.

If we review the commentaries on Peirce and Vygotsky, there is relatively little
in the secondary literature that emphasises their potential connections to Spinoza and Leibniz. A possible exception is Fisch’s article entitled ‘Peirce and
Leibniz’ (1986a), but this is largely a discussion of Peirce’s own views on Leibniz’s status as a philosopher. Fabbrichesi (2011) has also written a short article
on the relationship between Peirce and Leibniz’s theory of a universal language. The most fruitful discussion of Leibniz’s underlying influence on Peirce,
however, can be found in a paper by Bellucci (2013: 331–355). Here, he recognises that certain parallels can be drawn between Leibniz and Peirce – noting
their similarities in relation to ‘clear and distinct’ ideas, and ‘nominal’ and ‘real
definitions’. Beyond these instances in the Peircean exegesis, one finds few
mentions, however, of Leibniz in works on Peirce. In this context, it is perhaps
quite telling that it is a Leibnizian scholar, Loemker, who maintains that Peirce
“knew Leibniz better than any other American of his time” (Loemker 1989: 57).
In respect to Vygotsky, there is more widespread recognition of the influence of Spinoza on his work. Jan Derry (2013), as noted above, highlights the
impact of Spinoza on Vygotsky, but she does not extend her analysis to Peirce.
Elsewhere, Spinoza’s role in Vygotskian thought is sometimes acknowledged,

70

4 Hegel’s template of concept formation

but seldom explored in detail. Discussion often amounts to no more than an
observation that Spinoza was one of many earlier sources read by Vygotsky
(Meshcheryakov 2007: 155; Bakhurst 2007: 50). As discussed, few commentators
seek to explore the philosophical connections that exist between Leibniz and Spinoza, on the one hand, and Peirce and Vygotsky, on the other.

4.2 The Hegelian template
The works of Hegel are renowned for their complexity. Indeed, one commentator has called ‘The Science of Logic’ (Hegel: 2014) “the single densest book ever
written” (Carlson 2007). A full exploration of Hegel’s thought will not, therefore,
be attempted here. Instead, Hegel’s views on concept formation will be outlined
in some detail. They act as a useful reference point for our later discussions of
Peirce and Vygotsky.
Hegel begins his account of concept formation by rejecting Cartesian Dualism. As highlighted, he also discounts the idea that the mind has knowledge of
its sense data. Instead, he contends that intellect is initially confronted by indeterminate ‘Being’. He claims (Hegel 2014: 101) that “pure Being makes the beginning: because it is on the one hand pure thought, and on the other, immediacy
itself, simple and indeterminate; and the first beginning cannot be mediated by
anything, or be further determined”. This confirms Hegel’s rejection of ‘secondary dualism’ and, like Peirce, he asserts that perceptual indeterminacy is also
‘immediate’. There is thus no Kantian ‘veil of perception’ separating the human
mind from Being.
Faced with this perceptual indeterminacy, Hegel argues that the mind posits a putative identity – an ‘Essence’. This parallels the activity, encountered
earlier in Peirce and Vygotsky, when the intellect picks out a specific quality, or
object, from the perceptual continuum. As noted, this involves hypothesising
that a quality, or an object, can be classified as one thing and not another. In
Hegel’s terminology, the Essence thus begins the transition towards conceptual
‘determinacy’ (Hegel 2014: 109):
Hence Being Determinate is (1) the unity of Being and Nothing, in which we get rid of the
immediacy in these determinations, and their contradiction vanishes in their mutual connection – the unity in which they are only constituent elements. And (2) since the result
is the abolition of the contradiction, it comes in the shape of a simple unity with itself:
that is to say, it also is Being, but Being with negation and determinateness.

4.2 The Hegelian template

71

With a posited Essence, therefore, Hegel moves from immediate Being to a position in which Essences are distinguished from each other. For example, Hegel
asserts that (Hegel 2014: 133):
In the sphere of Being the reference of one term to another is only implicit: in Essence on
the contrary it is explicit. And this in general is the distinction between the forms of
Being and Essence: in Being everything is immediate, in Essence everything is relative.

These relational Essences remain, of course, little more than perceptual hypotheses. Hegel argues that “the sphere of Essence thus turns out to be an imperfect
combination of immediacy and mediation” (Hegel 2014: 137). They should be
understood, therefore, as mental approximations to reality and they contain intrinsic contradictions. Hegel argues that the mind can improve upon this position by identifying, and then eradicating, these contradictions. It is this which
initiates his advocacy of dialecticism. He maintains that by analysing the contents of posited Essences, the intellect can identify their inner contradictions
and render them more accurate manifestations of reality. Critically, he sees this
dialectical process as a logical one – hence his claim to a ‘Science of Logic’. And
this invocation also underpins one of his more famous claims for human rationality that, “what is reasonable is actual; and what is actual is reasonable”
(Hegel 2014: 5).
Hegel acknowledges the inner contradictions which are inherent in a posited
Essence and thus calls them ‘appearances’. He maintains, consequently, that Essences contain “intrinsic instability” (Hegel 2014: 156):
Appearance is higher than mere Being, – a richer category because it holds in combination the two elements of reflection-into-self and reflection-into-another: whereas Being
(or immediacy) is still mere relationlessness, and apparently rests upon itself alone. Still,
to say that anything is only an appearance suggests a real flaw, which consists in this,
that Appearance is still divided against itself and without intrinsic stability.

Hegel is also keen to emphasise two other aspects of these ‘appearances’.
Firstly, he claims that they are not atomised perceptions, as would be the case
in ‘secondary dualism’. As putative identities, they contain elements of Being
which may, or may not, be included later in more developed concepts. This is
important, because Hegel makes a distinction between Locke’s abstract ideas
(which are defined by one element only), and his own Essences which contain
many (relational) elements. This is why he contends that “in connection with
thought, the main thing is not to confuse the true Identity, which contains
Being and its characteristics ideally transfigured in it, with an abstract Identity,
identity of bare form” (Hegel 2014: 139).

72

4 Hegel’s template of concept formation

Secondly, Hegel insists that the internal structure of his ‘appearances’ entails a significant challenge to conventional understanding of the relationship
between form and content. As was seen, in ‘secondary dualism’, this relationship only works in one direction. Content comes first, and form (via identity) is
imposed by the inspecting mind. Hegel argues, however, that this is wrong. Because Essences are posited by the mind on the basis of something being one
thing and not another, they are already forms. This means that an Essence does
not represent a content passively awaiting form to be conferred upon it. Hegel
thus maintains that “the essential point to keep in mind about the opposition
of Form and Content is that the content is not formless, but has the form in its
own self, quite as much as the form is external to it. There is thus a doubling of
form” (Hegel 2014: 157).
As will be seen later, Peirce agrees with Hegel that the relationship between
form and content can be reversed. It will be suggested (in chapter 10) that, in
forming a Peircean sign, an icon, or ‘form’, comes first, and indexical ‘content’
then follows it. And in addition to this, Peirce also insists that any new content
(experienced through secondness) can always qualify an existing ‘form’ or create a new one. None of these possibilities occur, of course, in ‘secondary dualism’ where form and content are intrinsically separated from each other. Their
relationship is always linear because form can only be imposed on content
through interpretation.
Returning to Hegel, he argues that, in his dialecticism, concepts become progressively more refined. The human intellect learns to retain certain features of a
concept and revise others. Hegel calls this the “speculative stage” (Hegel 2014:
91) in concept formation and this is echoed by Peirce with his “speculative grammar” (EP2: 260). Importantly, in Hegel’s dialecticism, the mind identifies how a
particular Essence is connected to others and becomes a universal. As noted, Hegel’s vision of this concept is very different to that of Locke; the latter’s conception of a universal is always exhausted by a single quality. For Hegel, in contrast,
a universal emerges as it becomes ever more concrete, and more connected, with
the empirical world. It follows from this that a Hegelian universal should be
viewed as a concept finding its place in the universe; it is not something abstracted from the universe. This view is adopted by British neo-Hegelians, such
as Bosanquet and Bradley, at the end of the nineteenth century. When defining a
‘concrete universal’ they see it as involving what they call “identities in difference” (Acton 1936: 422). A concrete universal is, therefore, an identity which continues to exist despite the different relationships in which it becomes enmeshed.
As such, Acton argues, in Leibnizian fashion, that (Acton 1937: 1):

4.2 The Hegelian template

73

Julius Caesar is a universal because he is the same individual, although engaged in different activities, such as fighting in Gaul, marching in Italy, and so on. Abstracted from his
various activities, he is nothing; they are the differences which are required to make him
the identity he is.

Through the actions of dialecticism, Hegel claims that the human mind is able
to create new concepts which resolve the contradictions present in earlier versions of an Essence. Hegel uses an important term to describe this activity and
it is one that both Peirce and Vygotsky borrow in their work; this is the concept
of ‘aufheben’ or ‘sublation’ (Hegel 2014: 116). This important intellectual activity
carries out two actions simultaneously; it preserves what is present in an emerging concept and elevates it to a higher level where its contradictions are removed, and it can work in harmony with other Essences. As will be seen, this
Hegelian concept is critical to Peirce’s concept of ‘thirds’ and it is present in
Vygotsky’s account of the ‘higher psychological functions’. Critically, for all
three thinkers, sublated concepts become the very mechanisms through which
human beings experience the world. As such, Peircean ‘thirds’, for example,
enable the intellect to think about reality in ways which go beyond its immediate sense data. Hegel states, as a result, that “The Notion is the principle of
freedom, the power of substance self-realized” (Hegel 2014: 187). And Vygotsky
concurs on this point; it is sublated concepts which enable humans to reach
levels of conceptual sophistication above those of animals.
Hegel suggests that, as Essences develop, they also begin to form a network
of inter-relating Notions. This echoes the Leibnizian model discussed earlier.
These Essences are not ‘ideas’ in the Lockean sense; rather they are concepts
developing relational concreteness. For this reason, Hegel claims that “as it
was before remarked, the notion is a true concrete; for the reason that it involves Being and Essence, and the total wealth of these two spheres with them,
merged in the unity of thought” (Hegel 2014: 187–188). The dualisms of subjectivity and objectivity thus merge and Hegel is able to maintain that “if the Object, the product of this transition, be brought into relation with the notion,
which, so far as its special form is concerned, has vanished in it, we may give a
correct expression to the result, by saying that notion (or, if it be preferred, subjectivity) and object are implicitly the same” (Hegel 2014: 215).
In Hegel’s view, these interlocking Notions, emerging through the actions
of dialecticism, eventually establish what he calls the ‘Absolute Idea’ and this
leads him to advocate his ‘Absolute Idealism’ (Hegel 2014: 187) in which a web
of Notions are in harmony with each other. It must be emphasised, again, that
this outcome is not the same as the phenomenology advocated by modern social constructivists. Hegel would have firmly rejected their view that human
concepts are culturally defined. Instead, he views his emerging concepts as

74

4 Hegel’s template of concept formation

being dialectically determined, at least partially, by reality itself. It follows
from such a position that human beings are not free to construct their own
versions of the world – at either a cultural or individual level.
Before concluding this chapter, it is also useful to highlight two further aspects of Hegelian thought which influence Peirce and Vygotsky. Firstly, it is significant that Hegel’s account of concept formation, as outlined above, is triadic
in structure. There are three stages in his system: Being (sein), Essence (wesen)
and Notion (begriff). Peirce, as is well known, also uses triadic structures in his
semiotics. In Peirce, there are two versions of these. On the one hand, he proposes three categories – firstness, secondness and thirdness. On the other, he
advocates a triadic structure for the sign itself consisting of the representamen,
the object, and the interpretant. These two sets of triadic structures will be explored in chapters five and six.
The second aspect of Hegel’s system, which influences both Peirce and Vygotsky, is the critical idea of mediation. As highlighted above, Hegel explains
human concept formation by proposing the idea of a mediating Essence posited
by the mind. It is this entity which encapsulates the intellect’s initial hypothesis
of an experience, and which forms the vehicle for later dialecticism. The Hegelian Essence becomes, as a result, the locus of concept formation because it is
here that experience is logically resolved by the mind. This amalgamation of
the experiential and the rational within a mediating entity is a central aspect of
Hegel’s philosophy. It is how he overcomes the binary poles inherent in ‘secondary dualism’.
This idea of mediation is also present in Peirce and Vygotsky. For example,
Peirce describes the synthesis of thought and experience in the sign as “concrete reasonableness” (CP5: 3), whilst Vygotsky talks of human concepts as an
“amalgam” (Vygotsky 2012: 225). In using such terminology, both Peirce and
Vygotsky echo Hegel who had previously employed similar synthetic metaphors – those of “welding” (Hegel 1894: 457) and “fusion” (Hegel 1894: 458).
Inwood, when discussing the Hegelian model, also highlights (Inwood 1992:
185) the triadic nature of Hegel’s thought and how the idea of mediation is central to his account of concept formation:
Thus, mediation and immediacy form not a dyadic opposition, but a triad:
1) Bare (but still relative immediacy)
2) Mediation
3) Mediated Immediacy, in which an entity’s mediation is taken up into it
This pattern is repeated. The mediated immediacy that concludes one triad is the bare
immediacy that opens the next.

In this triadic structure, “bare immediacy” is the indeterminate perceptual
state involved in experiencing ‘Being’. The second stage, that of “mediation”,
takes place as the posited Essence becomes dialectically refined. In the third
stage, a Notion is gradually formed, and the mind uses this emerging concept
as a reflexive ‘tool’ to experience the world (Barnham 2020: 111). Inwood explicitly refers to this reflexive quality when he states above that “the mediated
immediacy that concludes one triad is the bare immediacy that opens the
next”.
What is important in this discussion, however, is that Hegel, Peirce, and
Vygotsky all believe that the ‘mediation’ is vital component of concept formation. However, the Hegelian approach to mediation, which Peirce and Vygotsky
later adopt, has been largely overlooked by modern commentators. In the case
of Peirce, this occurs when semioticians evaluate the triadic structure of his sign.
In their analyses, they frequently place the ‘object’ at the beginning of the signifying process, when, in fact, it should be placed, in a mediating position, within
his sign structure. Equally, in the case of Vygotsky, the Hegelian idea of mediation has been radically transformed by commentators. They reframe it in ways
which have overtones of social constructivism. Instead of focusing on the mediating nature of Vygotsky’s ‘word meaning’, commentators frequently construe ‘mediation’ as a social activity operating through specific cultural mechanisms.
Vygotsky’s invocation of ‘words’ and ‘speech’, as critical factors in concept formation, means, of course, that this is an extremely easy mistake to make. But, as
will be seen in due course, such modern interpretations gloss over the Hegelian
influences that underpin Vygotsky’s own views on mediation.

5 Peirce: The three categories
In this chapter, the first of Peirce’s two triads are analysed. Immersed in the
Phaneron, Peirce argues that the mind experiences reality through three categories, or logical modes, of being (EP2: 143). These categories are monadic, dyadic, or triadic in nature and they equate to possibility, actuality, and necessity
(EP1: 7). It is on this basis that Peirce establishes his categories of firstness, secondness, and thirdness.
The idea of experiential ‘categories’ first emerges with Kant. He suggests
they are four in number (e.g., quantity, quality, relation, and modality). This
approach is then adopted by Hegel, but in a different form. As already discussed, Hegel asserts that there are, instead, three stages (or ‘moments’) in experience – Being, Essence and Notion. And Peirce openly acknowledges that
his own categories follow Hegel’s structure when he states that “they agree substantially with Hegel’s three moments” (CP2: 87). Incidentally, Peirce also
maintains there can be no ‘fourths’ because these (if they did exist) could be reanalysed as triadic relationships (CP7: 537).
Before discussing Peirce’s categories in detail, it is important to highlight
some potential traps for the unwary. Peirce’s three categories, at first glance,
seem to map onto the familiar structures and terminology of the ‘nominalist’
position espoused by Locke. The latter maintains that the world comprises
‘qualities’ (‘secondary qualities’), objects (‘primary qualities’), and the laws of
nature (formed by the inspecting mind). These divisions appear to equate, respectively, to Peirce’s notions of firstness, secondness and thirdness. But to assume this convergence would be a profound mistake. In fact, all three of Peirce’s
categories operate differently to the Lockean model. These will be analysed during this chapter, but the most critical point of difference should be emphasised
upfront. Peirce argues that ‘thirds’, instead of being mental constructions (in line
with ‘secondary dualism’) are, in fact, phenomena which exist in the world. Peirce
certainly acknowledges that the mind is involved in their creation, giving them
synthetic existence, but he rejects the claim that the human intellect is solely responsible for them.

5.1 Firstness
Peirce’s initial category of firstness is monadic, and it transcends the properties
which are conventionally applied to philosophy’s ideas of ‘sense impressions’ or
‘qualities’. ‘Firsts’ share some of the properties of these more familiar philosophical
https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110695854-006

5.1 Firstness

77

concepts, but, at the same time, they also substantially reframe them. Most importantly, Peirce does not view ‘firsts’ as mental ‘effects’ in line with Locke’s ‘secondary qualities’. Firstness is a category of being which exists in the world, and which
is perceived directly (EP2: 150):
Imagine if you please, a consciousness in which there is no comparison, no relation, no
recognised multiplicity (since parts would be other than the whole), no change, no imagination of any modification of what is positively there, no reflexion, – nothing but a simple
positive character. Such a consciousness might be just an odour, say a smell of attar; or it
might be one infinite dead ache; it might be the hearing of [a] piercing eternal whistle. In
short, any simple and positive quality of feeling would be something which our description
fits, – that it is such as it is quite regardless of anything else. . . . The first category, then, is
Quality of Feeling, or whatever is such as it is positively and regardless of aught else.

The category of firstness also possesses a degree of spontaneity. It is ‘fresh’ because it has yet to be determined (e.g., compared with anything else) by the
mind (EP1: 248):
It must be fresh and new, for if old it is second to its former state. It must be initiative,
original, spontaneous, and free; otherwise, it is second to a determining cause. It is also
something vivid and conscious; so only it avoids being the object of some sensation. It
precedes all synthesis and all differentiation: it has no unity and no parts. It cannot be
articulately thought: assert it, and it has already lost its characteristic innocence; for assertion always implies a denial of something else. Stop to think of it, and it has flown!

A ‘first’, therefore, is a quality, but if the intellect begins to think about it, or
compare it with other firsts, it immediately ceases to be a ‘first’. It is a quality,
but as soon as an attempt is made to specify what it is, a description of it is
created. As Boler notes, a ‘first’ is a “bare thisness” (Boler 1963: 122). As such, it
has a status akin to Peirce’s ‘percept’ before it becomes a ‘perceptual judgement’. Moreover, a ‘first’ is never experienced as a ‘atomised’ sense datum. It is
only experienced as it is embodied in something else. As such, it is always experienced as necessarily conjoined with other percepts and it can only be considered as a ‘first’ (Short 2007: 75) if the mind prescinds it from the embodied state
in which it is initially experienced.
When Peirce offers instances of ‘firsts’ he provides examples that can be recognised as Lockean ‘qualities’ – such as the sensations of colour and warmth.
But he also mentions other examples such as the ‘emotional’ reaction one feels
when watching a performance of ‘King Lear’ (CP1: 531), or the effect of listening
to a piece of music (CP5: 475). This explains his description of ‘firsts’ as types of
“consciousness”; they are not atomised sense impressions. Indeed, if we look at
the precise terminology that Peirce uses to describe ‘firsts’, he often talks about
them as “qualities of feeling” (EP2: 150) – phraseology that conflates two aspects

78

5 Peirce: The three categories

of experience which are neatly separated by ‘secondary dualism’ – where ‘qualities’ are what is experienced and ‘feelings’ are their effects upon us. Peirce, therefore, runs the two notions together. This inclusion of “qualities of feeling” in
experience also explains why Peirce refuses to limit our experience of ‘firsts’ to
the narrow range permitted by the five senses. Experience now includes, as it
does for Hegel, how individuals feel in the world.21 A ‘first’ can, for example, be
how someone feels as they walk into a room of strangers. Critically, however,
Peirce still emphasises that a ‘first’ remains a simple feeling (EP1: 275) – even
though the phenomenon experienced (such as a performance of ‘King Lear’) can
be complex.
Peirce also maintains that ‘firsts’ are real. In a passage entitled the ‘Reality of
Firstness’, he again asserts that they are different to the ‘sense impressions’ of empiricism. He argues that “but as for Qualities, they are supposed to be in consciousness merely, with nothing in the real thing to correspond to them except
mere degrees of more or less . . . . But when one considers the matter from a logical point of view the notion that qualities are illusions and play no part in the real
universe shows itself to be a peculiarly unfounded opinion” (EP2: 187–188).
Peirce’s ‘firsts’ should also be compared with universals. It has been noted
that Hegel rejects the conventional view that universals are abstracted sense
data based on a single quality. However, because a Peircean ‘first’ can be
‘greenness’ or ‘blueness’, it is quite easy to assume that it, too, has been abstracted by the mind. Peirce, however, insists that we should distinguish between two separate activities. These are ‘abstraction’ and ‘prescision’. For
nominalists, an abstract idea is created when the mind identifies shared qualities between its perceptions. The intellect has an idea of blueness because it
identifies similarities amongst several blue things. For Peirce, however, the activity of ‘prescision’ is quite different – it is the mental action of removing a
quality (a ‘first’) from its embodied state. This creates a new mental entity, but
not one that is formed by grouping together atomised perceptions. As a result,
Peirce insists that a ‘first’ retains its underlying relationships with other qualities and cannot be detached from the context in which it is experienced. The
reason for this, of course, is that a ‘first’ only exists as it does within a specific
context. It is not, therefore, a free-standing quality (known directly); its quality
remains entirely dependent upon its context even when it has been prescinded.

21 It is of note that Peirce even borrows a Hegelian term when describing ‘firsts’. On occasions, Hegel talks of a ‘prius’ (e.g., Hegel [1830] 1894: 381). This is because Hegel places the
‘first’ at the beginning of his logical dialecticism.

5.2 Secondness

79

To illustrate this, Peirce offers the example of a diamond and the quality of
‘hardness’. He states that “this diamond’s condition is not an isolated fact.
There is no such thing; and an isolated fact could hardly be real. It is an unsevered, though presciss, part of the unitary fact of nature” (EP2: 356). Hardness is
thus not a ‘property’ of the diamond in any absolute sense; it does not exist
separately from the various contexts in which the diamond is found (Gallie
1952: 191). The hardness of the diamond is not, as a result, a known ‘fact’. It is
simply a relational possibility that exists within the diamond itself, which is either actualized, or not, according to the contexts in which it is found. And, critically, it follows from this that the intellect does not know all the relational
properties of the diamond because it has not been experienced in all possible
circumstances. The stone may contain new properties that arise in new contexts, and which exist only ‘in potentia’. The diamond could, for example, become a liquid if taken to Pluto. This parallels the shared insight of Spinoza and
Leibniz that the mind has only partial knowledge of the world.
To summarise, Peircean ‘firsts’ appear to be a category of experience which
has similarities with the atomised ‘secondary qualities’ of nominalism. But
these similarities are misleading. ‘Firsts’ are perceived directly; they are not
mental ‘effects’ and, as a category of being, they are also real. Moreover, they
combine both experiential and mental characteristics because, as prescinded
qualities, they can only be experienced in embodied form. This also means that
they are intrinsically relational in nature and are quite unlike the abstract ideas
of the nominalist tradition.

5.2 Secondness
The category of secondness, as the name suggests, is fundamentally dyadic in
nature; it involves the interaction of two entities. And secondness operates in
two ways; either between the world and the self, or between two observed ‘objects’ in the world. Peirce provides an example of the former; the pressing of
one’s shoulder against a half open door (EP2: 150). This action involves effort
on one’s own part, but also the resistance of the door itself. Another example is
the experience of being hit on the head by a man carrying a ladder (EP2: 150).
On both occasions there is effort and resistance; secondness involves an acknowledgement of something ‘other’ impinging upon the senses (EP1: 249):
We find secondness in occurrence, because an occurrence is something whose existence
consists in our knocking up against it. A hard fact is of the same sort; that is to say, it is
something which is there, and which I cannot think away, but am forced to acknowledge

80

5 Peirce: The three categories

as an object or second beside myself, the subject or number one, and which forms material for the exercise of my will.

Secondness is also experienced when the mind observes two objects interacting
with each other in the world; a diamond being scratched is an example. It is
important to emphasise, however, that these actions should be treated as ‘raw’
experiences – they do not involve any knowledge of causal laws because these
would be ‘thirds’. Peirce thus maintains that any experience of a ‘second’ cannot be extrapolated into the future. He contends that “we not only thus experience Secondness, but we attribute it to outward things; which we regard as so
many individual objects, or quasi-selves, reacting on one another. Secondness
only is while it actually is. The same thing can never happen twice” (EP2: 268).
Secondness, therefore, is a dyadic interaction perceived momentarily; it does
not involve two entities having a relationship because this would last through
time. And Boler agrees on this point, suggesting that “although secondness can
be experienced, it is non-conceptual” (Boler 1963: 122) This, however, still
leaves open the possibility that secondness is, in fact, a single experience of a
dyadic event. As such, it might be argued that secondness could collapse into
firstness. Peirce, however, rejects this; a ‘second’ always involves the additional
sense of limiting a ‘first’. Of necessity, it must involve a sense of resistance; it is
how the mind discovers its limits in the world.22
Secondness can thus be construed as the experience of something ‘other’.
Care must be taken, however, to avoid the mistaken conclusion that this amounts
to objectivity. As noted, Peirce is anti-dualist and his notion of secondness does
not equate to the existence of an ‘objective world’ of matter. This is occasionally
misunderstood by commentators. Olteanu, for example, argues that “objectivity
is the definition of secondness” (2015: 267), whilst Semetsky concludes that ‘seconds’ are “matter” (2010: 64), or “the mechanical aspect” of the natural world
(Semetsky 2010: 66). In contrast, secondness should be understood within Peirce’s account of perception. Critically, as was noted above, he construes human
perceptions as being indeterminate. The central role of secondness is, as a result,
to set limits on this indeterminacy. This is why Peirce describes secondness, in
the first quotation in this section, as being “a hard fact” (EP1: 249) and why

22 There is a parallel here between Peirce’s concept of secondness and Merleau-Ponty’s account of the human body. The latter describes it as follows: “The body is the vehicle of being
in the world and, for a living being, having a body means being united with a definite milieu,
merging with certain projects, and being perpetually engaged with therein”. (Merleau-Ponty
2012: 84). This also parallels Noë’s invocation of human sensorimotor skills (Noë 2004: 35–73)
as an intrinsic and necessary part of perceptual acts.

5.2 Secondness

81

Peirce often uses two key terms when discussing secondness – those of “struggle” and “surprise”. Peirce states that “the next simplest feature that is common
to all that comes before the mind, and consequently, the second category, is the
element of Struggle” (EP2: 150). And he confirms this by asking “precisely how
does this action of experience take place? It takes place by a series of surprises”
(EP2:154).
The category of secondness, therefore, involves the discovery that the
world is not how we expect it to be.23 This is an important feature of Peirce’s
account of concept formation. It is through secondness that he believes reality
plays a role in this process. This can be illustrated (Figure 3) by showing how
secondness limits the indeterminacy of ‘vague’ perceptions:

ETC….

Figure 3: The Action of Secondness Determining ‘Vagues’.

For Peirce, this incessant activity of secondness limiting indeterminacy is how
reality determines the content of human concepts. Crucially, these concepts
can only contain the meanings that reality permits them to have; they acquire
an ever more determinate character dictated by the world itself. Peirce states
(EP2: 24), for example, that:

23 There is a delicious irony here. As students of philosophy know well, the scepticism of Descartes is based on the observation that the mind is sometimes surprised by its senses. For example, a stick can look bent when placed in water. Descartes uses such examples to suggest
that philosophers should not trust their senses. But with the idea of secondness, Peirce takes
exactly the opposite view. The fact that the world surprises us is evidence that ‘something’ is
there; it imposes its effects on the mind’s nascent ideas. Peirce, therefore, turns the sceptical
argument on its head. Indeed, Descartes’s position is only credible if it is first accepted that
the mind ‘knows’ its sense data. But neither Hegel, nor Peirce, would agree with his premise.

82

5 Peirce: The three categories

It thus appears that all knowledge comes to us by observation. A part is forced upon us
from without and seems to result from Nature’s mind; a part comes from the depths of the
mind as seen from within, which by an egotistical anacoluthon we call our mind.

Ibri concurs with this argument, and highlighting Peirce’s ‘objective idealism’
which includes a role for reality in concept making, he argues that (Ibri 2014: 39):
The act of constantly dealing with the object, with that which can always, potentially,
object to its representation, must lead to the admission of an objective reality, indifferent
to any constituting appropriation of a subjective nature.

Likewise, Romanini agrees, in the same volume, that the role of reality is to
challenge human understanding. He states that “the friction of experience is
Peirce’s second category, or Secondness” (Romanini 2014: 221).
It is useful, at this point, to compare Peirce with Saussure. To take an example,
Saussure might argue that a particular culture has arbitrarily separated ‘tigers’
from domestic ‘cats’ – by using two different terms to denote them. Saussure
might claim, indeed, that this culture could have called them both ‘cats’. Peirce
would point out, however, that this would be very foolish; his category of secondness would create ‘surprise’. If members of this culture attempted to feed the large
stripy ‘cat’, it might well eat them instead. Reality, in the form of ‘secondness’,
would thus demonstrate to us that cats and tigers are very different identities. As
such, Peirce would argue that the mind is not at liberty to ‘divide up’ the world in
the manner advocated by Saussure. Instead, in ‘A Guess at the Riddle’, Peirce maintains that this is precisely how secondness operates. He states that “it [secondness]
is very familiar, too; it is forced upon us daily: it is the main lesson of life. In youth
the world is fresh, and we seem free; but limitation, conflict, constraint and secondness generally, make up the teaching of experience” (EP1: 249). Secondness is,
therefore, the action of reality upon the human mind. It limits the scope of our initially indeterminate concepts and forces us to revise their inclusions.
Importantly, in this discussion, Peirce’s relationship with Hegel also comes
to a head with his concept of secondness. Indeed, the vehemency of Peirce’s
attack on Hegel on this issue simply confirms that his own project has much in
common with that of Hegel. In some ways, however, Peirce’s account seems to
follow Hegelian lines; Peirce even talks about secondness as a confrontation
between the “ego” and the “non-ego” (EP2: 154). But Peirce fundamentally diverges from Hegel with his claim that the latter gives too little emphasis to secondness in the development of concepts. This, in Peirce’s view, involves a
serious neglect of what he calls the “Outward Clash” (EP1: 233). And it is this
oversight which leads Peirce to describe Hegel (EP2: 156–157), rather misleadingly, as a nominalist.

5.2 Secondness

83

In Peirce’s view, Hegel’s triadic model describes the development of human
knowledge, but it removes reality too much from the dialectical process and renders the latter an entirely mental and logical activity. This position, Peirce argues,
is deeply flawed; the mind, he argues, cannot ascertain the true nature of Hegel’s
Essences by simply considering their inner contradictions. Logic, Peirce believes,
cannot perform this task by itself; only secondness can provide the necessary ‘surprises’ required to revise human thinking. Peirce contends, as a result, that Hegel
fails to grant reality a big enough role in concept formation (EP1: 233):
The capital error of Hegel which permeates his whole system in every part of it is that he
almost altogether ignores the Outward Clash. Besides the lower consciousness of feeling
and the higher consciousness of nutrition, this direct consciousness of hitting and of getting hit enters into all cognition and serves to make it mean something real.

And (EP1: 237):
When Hegel tells me that thought has three stages, that of naïve acceptance, that of reaction and criticism, and that of rational conviction; in a general sense, I agree to it . . . .
But be that as it may, the idea that the mere reaction of assent and doubt, the mere play
of thought, the heat-lightning of the brain, is going to settle anything in this real world to
which we appertain, – such an idea only shows again how the Hegelians overlook the
facts of volitional action & reaction in the development of thought. I find myself in a
world of forces which act upon me, and it is they and not the logical transformations of
my thought which determine what I shall ultimately believe.

But is Peirce justified in this criticism? The general tone of Hegel writings
would suggest that Peirce is correct. But Peirce, in fact, overlooks key aspects
of Hegel’s position. Firstly, the Hegelian Notion evolves from an Essence which
is, itself, derived from reality. As such, Essences contain, potentially, everything that is required for an ‘Outward Clash’ to occur within their inner contradictions. Hegel states, for example, that “and yet, as it was before remarked,
the notion is a true concrete; for the reason that it involves Being and Essence,
and the total wealth of these two spheres with them, merged in the unity of
thought” (2014: 187–188). Nagl picks up on this argument and points out that
“Hegel’s core idea that Aufhebung implies not one but three meanings: not only
negatio, but also conservatio and elevatio. If this insight is considered, neither
‘immediacy’ (Firstness), nor the ‘outward clash’ (i.e., the surprise-generating
difference between hypothesis and object) can be said to disappear in toto in
Hegel’s ‘mediation’” (Nagl 2014: 433).
Secondly, the on-going nature of experience always brings new Essences
into Hegel’s dialectical process. These demand integration with existing Essences and so reality continually provides new inputs into concept formation.
Thirdly, Peirce also overlooks the fact that Hegel insists that human concepts

84

5 Peirce: The three categories

reflexively inform perception. This means that each time a concept is used, the
intellect is re-evaluating its utility in the world; the mind may thus encounter
new phenomena which demand revisions to its concepts. As such, it seems that
Hegel does, in fact, preserve a major role for reality in concept formation. And
Hegel, in the same passage cited above, even rejects the position that Peirce
accuses him of holding (Hegel 2014: 189–190):
The Logic of the Notion is usually treated as a science of form only, and understood to
deal with the form of notion, judgment, and syllogism as form, without in the least touching the question of whether anything is true. The answer to that question is supposed to
depend on the content only. If the logical forms of the notion really were dead and inert
receptacles of conceptions and thoughts, careless of what they contained, knowledge
about them would be an idle curiosity which the truth might dispense with. On the contrary they really are, as forms of the notion, the vital spirit of the actual world.

This passage shows that Hegel is alert to the potential challenge that his emergent Notions could become detached from reality. This interpretation of Hegel
is also supported by Kaag, who points out that Hegel’s concept of Essence, in
the German, is ‘Wesen’ and that this “stems from ‘Gewesen’ (been), the past
participle of Sein” (e.g., ‘Being’). Kaag argues, as a result, that a Hegelian Essence will include previous empirical experiences (Kaag: 2011). It seems, therefore, in his eagerness to distance himself from Hegel, Peirce has overlooked key
aspects of his predecessor’s thought.

5.3 Thirdness
Thirdness is an important category for Peirce because it is the one category of
being that provides knowledge of the law-like nature of reality. As noted, secondness provides a sense of ‘something else’, and it surprises the mind, but this
limiting category only operates momentarily. It does not provide an on-going
understanding of how reality operates at the level of cause and effect. The nominalist equivalent of Peircean thirdness is, of course, the conviction that the
mind forms interpretations of observed ‘constant conjunctions’ (through Humean ‘habit’) and that these provide understanding of the world. In contrast,
Peirce argues that reality itself manifests the category of thirdness and that it is
directly perceived. ‘Thirds’, it follows, are not merely human interpretations.
‘Thirds’ are, by definition, triadic. This point needs careful explanation.
Peirce sees thirdness as a level of experience whereby the mind perceives relationships. A dyadic relationship is one that exists between two phenomena. A
triadic relationship, on the other hand, is the experience of a dyadic relationship

5.3 Thirdness

85

observed from another perspective. In Peirce’s synechistic model this can occur
from any point in the web of relationships that constitute the universe. It is always possible, in this framework, to view a relationship from a third perspective.
In a universe of such relationships, ‘thirds’ are always present in reality – either
explicitly or implicitly.
The notion of the ‘third’ has important consequences in two contexts – in
the social sphere and in the physical world. The social dimension will be considered first because many of Peirce’s illustrations of thirdness are social ones.
For example, in a discussion of the act of ‘giving’, Peirce talks as follows: “A
presents C to B by any aggregate of dual relations between A and B, B and C,
and C and A. A may enrich B, B may receive C, and A may part with C, and yet
A need not necessarily give C to B. For that, it would be necessary that these
three dual relations should not only co-exist, but be welded into one fact” (EP1:
252). Another example that Peirce gives is the action of a stone being thrown
out of a window by a merchant. This stone kills his son. This action could be
broken down into the action of the stone being thrown and the action of the
son being killed, but Peirce rejects this atomised construal. Instead, if it is asserted that the ‘merchant killed his son’ a single observed relationship is established: “had it been aimed at him, the case would have been different; for then
there would have been a relation of aiming which would have connected together the aimer, the thing aimed, and the object aimed at, in one fact” (EP1:
254). Thirdness, therefore, brings two actions together and the mind perceives
them as one event; it resists the nominalist temptation to break the experience
into separate elements. Critically, a ‘third’ does not, therefore, involve two
events which are then re-assembled through interpretation. Instead, ‘thirds’
allow the intellect to experience relationships that exist in the world. And this
is why Peirce can also talk of the “firstness of thirdness” (CP5: 113). Acts of ‘giving’ and ‘murder’ are, consequently, not the outcomes of cultural construction;
they are directly experienced phenomena.
Importantly, for our later analysis of his semiotics, Peircean ‘thirds’ add an
additional layer to his account of perception. These stages in perception can be
outlined as follows:
1. Simple ‘vague’ perceptions. These are Peirce’s ‘firsts’.
2. Perceptions that we have categorised in some way. They involve the mind
determining that something is one thing and not another. Secondness operates here because reality forces the mind to make such distinctions. Crucially, this stage involves experiencing something as something. This is the
stage where Peirce’s ‘perceptual judgments’ classify percepts.
3. Perceptions that involve the experience of relationships in the world. They do
not involve interpretations of relationships between two atomised actions.

86

5 Peirce: The three categories

This means that ‘thirds’, critically, involve the experience of something as
something else. This is distinct from level (2) where ‘perceptual judgments’
simply categorise things as something. It is this factor that raises Peircean
‘thirds’ above the level of ‘perceptual judgments’.
This triadic framework helps explain why a ‘third’ is an essential requirement
for sign formation. Signs are precisely how the human mind experiences the
world through a new lens; they allow it to experience something as something
else. Peirce proposes, as a result, that all ‘genuine’ signs involve thirdness because they display this essential characteristic.
This feature of the Peircean ‘third’ also marks a critical departure from much
of modern semiology. It is frequently maintained, and rightly so, that a sign
‘stands for something else’. Eco, for example, states that “according to the ancient
definition, a sign is something that stands in the place of something else” (Eco
2018: 344). But it is important to understand exactly what this claim entails and
how it differentiates Peirce from other semioticians. Peirce asserts that, in the
case of ‘thirds’, the intellect directly perceives something as something else. But
this is not the same claim as Eco’s assertion that a sign “stands in the place of
something else”. In Eco’s model the sign, as a known ‘sign vehicle’, stands for
something else because it is interpreted as such. This is quite different from Peirce’s claim that ‘thirds’ allow us to perceive something as something else. In Eco’s
formulation, a sign is a known sense datum which then has its initial meaning
changed through interpretation. This contrasts with Peirce who argues that something else is directly perceived in a ‘third’. Peirce has no need, as a result, for the
language of interpretation, or, indeed, semiotic codes. Instead, new identities (in
the form of interpretants) are encountered directly at a perceptual level. And, of
course, Eco’s view that a known identity can ‘stand for something else’ stems
from the familiar source. The core contention of ‘secondary dualism’ is that the
intellect already knows the identity of its sense impressions before signification
takes place. This is why Eco adopts a different account of the notion of ‘standing
for something else’ compared with Peirce.24

24 It is instructive to consider how Eco interprets Peirce’s three categories. The passage below
shows how it is possible to misunderstand Peirce’s triadic model. Eco suggests (Eco 2018: 346):
I place my hand on the stove and burn myself: firstness is the moment at which I perceive
pain, and I would perceive it even if I had sudden cramps in my intestines without any
external agent causing them. Secondness is the moment at which, although still in a confused way, I identify the stove in front of me as the cause of the pain, something that is

5.3 Thirdness

87

Returning to our discussion of the social dimension, the question will arise
as to the exact origin of a ‘third’. Surely, there might still be some social convention involved in the phenomenon of ‘giving’? How else, for example, could
it become established? But the way in which a Peircean ‘third’ is created can be
explained within his model of perception. An individual can, for example, observe certain similarities between acts of ‘passing a thing’ from one person to
another and begin to categorise them as a distinct type of activity. As such, a
‘perceptual judgement’ classifies them as ‘acts of giving’ in a way that distinguishes them from other acts of ‘passing a thing’. This takes place at an individual level and does not involve any social agreement even though the subject
matter of the ‘third’ is social.
The social constructivist may claim, in response to this Peircean position,
that a combination of individual ‘perceptual judgements’ creates a cultural convention. But this claim should also be rejected. Just because individual perceptions are alike, this does not mean that they are socially constructed; this
would equate, for example, to the claim that trees are ‘socially constructed’ because several people know what a tree looks like. Instead, the social constructivist needs to show that either the act of ‘giving’ is created at a social level, or
that some (even tacit) social agreement exists. Peirce, however, has no requirement to invoke either of these assumptions; his account is firmly based on individual perceptual categorisations. Of course, there may well be disagreement
about how different individuals classify an ‘act of giving’ and this may result in
different notions of ‘giving’ being formed. But, as will be seen in due course,
the way in which individuals negotiate what is included, or not included, in
their concepts is a matter of how symbols are used.
As noted, Peircean ‘thirds’ also inform human understanding of the physical world. When the intellect observes two events which are juxtaposed, the direct perception of a ‘third’ means that it does not experience them as separate
actions; they are seen as one event (EP2: 5):

opposing me. Thirdness is the moment at which I pass to the order of the symbolic and
say (and think) ‘stove’, that is to say, “It is the stove that burned me”.
This account of Peirce’s three categories involves a series of mistakes. Firstness is reduced to a
simple sense impression, or quality. Eco, it is true, accepts that he might be mistaken about
the source of the sense impression, but this is not the same as saying that the sensation is
indeterminate. Secondness is not construed by Eco as a limiting factor that determines the
identity of the sensation. Instead, it is viewed as indicating the objective cause of the pain.
Thirdness is construed as an interpretation.

88

5 Peirce: The three categories

He finds that one action is the means, or middle, for bringing about another result. This
third state of mind is entirely different from the other two [firstness and secondness]. In
the second there was only a sense of brute force; now there is a sense of government by a
general rule. In Reaction [e.g., secondness] only two things are involved; but in government there is a third thing which is a means to an end. The very word means signifies
something which is in the middle between two others.

In human experience, therefore, ‘thirds’ create knowledge of physical regularities and natural laws; they are not created by interpretation. As such, Peirce
argues that the objects form ‘habits’ (CP1: 327–329). In a letter to Lady Welby,
he states that “the third Universe consists of the co-being of whatever is in its
Nature necessitant, that is, is a Habit, a law, or something expressible in a universal proposition” (EP2: 479).
‘Habits’, therefore, belong to objects (or identities); they are “general principles” which are “operative in nature” (EP2: 183) rather than mere constructions of the mind. For example, Peirce states that (EP2: 418):
If we now revert to the psychological assumption originally made, we shall see that it is
already largely eliminated by the consideration that habit is by no means exclusively a
mental fact. Empirically, we find that some plants take habits. The stream of water that
wears a bed for itself is forming a habit. Every ditcher so thinks of it.

And, elsewhere, Peirce suggests that “belief is not a momentary mode of consciousness; it is a habit of mind essentially enduring for some time, and mostly
(at least) unconscious; and like other habits, it is (until it meets with some surprise that begins its dissolution) perfectly self-satisfied. Doubt is of an altogether contrary genus. It is not a habit, but the privation of a habit” (EP2:
336–337). It is clear, therefore, that Peirce believes that doubt only arises in the
mind when an expectation of reality (based on habit) is surprised by the category of secondness. When this occurs, the intellect feels the need to address
what Peirce describes as an “irritation of doubt” (CP1: 114).
Returning to the philosophy of Hegel, it is also possible to discern parallels
between Peirce’s ‘thirds’ and the ‘notions’ of Hegel with respect to the physical
world. In particular, the Hegel insists that cause and effect should be comprehended as one event and as a unity. They are only separated into two events in
the atomistic model of ‘secondary dualism’. As a result, Hegel critiques the conventional view of causation as follows (Hegel 2014: 181):
In the common acceptation of the causal relation the cause is finite, to such extent as its
content is so (as is also the case with finite substance), and so far as cause and effect are
conceived as two several independent existences: which they are, however, only when
we leave the causal relation out of sight.

5.3 Thirdness

89

In otherwords, causation only appears to consist of separate events if the nominalist insists on their mistaken demand to experience a causal connection (e.g.,
a ‘sense impression’ of the connection itself). Hegel maintains, in contrast to
this, that philosophers ought to conceive of cause and effect as two aspects of
the same event. In this way, Hegel again foreshadows Peirce when he states
that (Hegel 2014: 181):
But these two terms [cause and effect], if they are distinct, are also identical. Even in ordinary consciousness that identity may be found. We say that a cause is a cause, only when
it has an effect, and vice versa. Both cause and effect are thus one and the same content:
and the distinction between them is primarily only that the one lays down, and the other
is laid down.

6 Mediation in Peirce: The structure of the sign
Peirce’s three categories and the way they inform the mind’s experience of reality have now been discussed. This chapter builds upon this platform by evaluating how the intellect begins to understand the world. In the Hegelian model
this involves a mediating entity – the ‘Essence’. It enables a putative identity to
be posited which provides an intellectual locus for further development. In this
chapter, discussion will focus on the Peircean equivalent of the Hegelian Essence and how it evolves. Critically, with Peircean semiotics, this mediating entity is the ‘object’ within his triadic sign.
Earlier, it was suggested that it is relatively easy to assume that Peirce’s
three categories mirror conventional distinctions between secondary qualities,
primary qualities, and the inferred laws of nature. In this chapter there is a similar theoretical pitfall to be avoided. This is the mistake of assuming that the three
elements of Peirce’s triadic sign – the representamen, the object, and the interpretant – map onto structures familiar in ‘secondary dualism’. These erroneous
construals involve an object (behind the sign), a sense impression (which is
transmitted from the object to the mind) and an interpretation (which is the intellect’s understanding of the sense impression). If this conventional structure is imposed on Peircean semiotics, signs are reduced to little more than a special class
of sense data and his sign theory would be little more than another incarnation
of ‘secondary dualism’. But fortunately this is not the case; Peirce, following
Hegel, views the sign as involving a mediating entity – the object within the sign.
As a result, this chapter will suggest that the structure of the Peircean sign reflects Hegel’s triadic model of Being, Essence and Notion. There are, of course,
some important differences between these two templates, but these should not
mask their considerable similarities.

6.1 The representamen
The representamen is widely agreed to be the first element in the Peircean sign.
However, not all perceptions are representamens. If a perception is not caught
up in semiosis (which results in an interpretant) it will not become a representamen. Many perceptions are, in fact, involved in semiosis, but until this happens, they remain only potential representamens. Peirce states that (EP2: 273):
Namely, while no Representamen actually functions as such until it actually determines
an Interpretant, yet it becomes a Representamen as soon as it is fully capable doing this;

https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110695854-007

6.1 The representamen

91

and its Representative Quality is not necessarily dependent upon its ever actually determining an Interpretant, nor even upon its actually having an Object.

The factor which transforms a perception into a representamen is the recognition that it is something that has been seen before. Observed repetition is key
here for Peirce (EP2: 203):
The mode of being of a representamen is such that it is capable of repetition . . . . A representamen which should have a unique embodiment, incapable of repetition, would not
be a representamen, but a part of the very fact represented.

Peirce’s emphasis on repetition suggests that, at the beginning of semiosis, an
act of classification takes place. The perceiver, sub-consciously or not, feels
that one perceptual experience is like another. Earlier, it was noted that this
happens when a ‘perceptual judgment’ classifies a percept. A representamen,
therefore, is a ‘perceptual judgment’ that has entered a sign (and determines an
interpretant). This embeds Peirce’s semiotics in his theory of perception.
Over the length of his career, Peirce is quite inconsistent when using the
term ‘representamen’, so it is helpful to understand why Peirce sometimes adopts
it.25 Misleadingly, the term can suggest the kind of ‘representation’ found in ‘secondary dualism’. This would mean that a representamen would simply be a
‘copy’ of an object ‘behind’ it. But ‘perceptual judgments’ are not like this; they
are not copies of a ‘noumenal’ world. Instead, they are putative (and ‘vague’)
classifications of perceptions. This is important, for if the representamen is intrinsically ‘vague’, then the task of sign action is to transform this indeterminacy
into something more defined. And this begins to explain why Peirce describes
signs as being determined by their objects. He uses this terminology precisely because the representamen is, by its very nature, indeterminate. And this view is, of
course, founded in his relational account of perception.
To fail to understand this key characteristic of the representamen is to
make a fundamental mistake about the nature of Peircean semiotics. His sign
theory diverges from Saussure because he is concerned with the evolution that
occurs from a ‘vague’ representamen to a more ‘determinate’ sign. This is never
an issue for a semiologist such as Saussure because he is only concerned with
linkages between known sign vehicles and their cultural meanings. In contrast,
Peirce is following a different philosophical tradition; the Hegelian transition
from ‘Being’ to ‘Notion’. Many commentators, however, do not recognise this

25 Deledalle (1992: 294) records Peirce’s usage of the term ‘representamen’. Peirce uses this
terminology until 1873 and then drops it until 1895. He then re-adopts it from 1895 until 1903,
when it is abandoned once again.

92

6 Mediation in Peirce: The structure of the sign

characteristic of the Peircean representamen. Jappy, for instance, maintains
that it is simply the sign itself: (Jappy 2013: 13):
To conclude, then, a sign is a representamen, that is the first element in the triadic relation, but owing to the fact that it has an animate interpreter and therefore a mental interpretant, it is but one of many different species of representamens. Nevertheless, the
reader should bear in mind that Peirce adopts the term ‘representamen’ in many of the
quotations to come and should substitute the term ‘sign’ for the sake of simplicity.

Such a view simply transforms the representamen into a ‘sign vehicle’. Elsewhere, Hookway, highlighting that Peirce’s use of the term ‘representamen’ is
often inconsistent, also suggests that the term be abandoned and that semioticians should speak in terms of ‘signs’ (Hookway 1985: 121). And Greenlee, to
the same effect, maintains that semioticians should “dismiss the distinction between ‘sign’ and ‘representamen’ and speak only of signs” (Greenlee 1973: 46).
Such proposals, however, result in several misunderstandings. For not only
does the representamen quickly become a Saussurean ‘sign vehicle’, but Peirce’s critical insistence on the ‘vagueness’ of the representamen is also lost. And
there are additional repercussions for the structure of the sign itself. Peirce believes that the sign is more than just the representamen – it is the whole triadic
relationship formed by the unity of the representamen, object and interpretant.
But by reducing the sign to just one element of this relationship (e.g., the representamen) commentators thus impose Saussurean thinking on Peirce’s sign
structure.
But this mistake only begins to tell the full story of how Peirce’s sign structure is sometimes misconstrued. Problems of interpretation escalate further
when consideration is given to the next element in Peirce’s sign: the ‘object’.

6.2 The ‘object’
There is, perhaps, no other term in Peircean sign theory that causes more confusion than his ‘object’ in the sign. Given Peirce’s clear rejection of dualism, the
fact that Peirce uses this term at all when describing his sign structure seems
somewhat paradoxical. Is he, after all, abandoning his anti-dualistic stance? Or
is he using the term in a manner that somehow incorporates his rejection of dualism? At the centre of this debate lies the Hegelian concept of mediation and the
question as to where the object is positioned within Peirce’s sign structure.
To begin our discussion, two accounts of his sign structure can be evaluated. They both seem to correspond, prima facie, with Peirce’s own position by

6.2 The ‘object’

93

referencing his ‘triadic’ structure of the sign, but both accounts order the elements of his sign incorrectly.
The first of these accounts is to be found in Ogden and Richards’s work,
‘The Meaning of Meaning’ (Ogden and Richards: 1989). Written in 1923, Fisch
sees this work as “the first book in any language from which it was possible to
get a grasp of Peirce’s semeiotic at first hand, in his own terms” (Fisch 1986a:
345). As a result, their views were probably influential in subsequent interpretations of Peirce. In a footnote in their book, they state, possibly referring to
Peirce himself (Ogden and Richards 1989: 9n):
It has seemed desirable, therefore, to introduce a technical term to stand for whatever we
may be thinking of or referring to. ‘Object’ though this is its original use, has had an unfortunate history. The word ‘referent’, therefore, has been adopted, though its etymological form is open to question when considered in relation to other participial derivatives,
such as agent or reagent.

Ogden and Richards thus recognise that there is some confusion relating to the
term ‘object’ and they introduce the idea of the ‘referent’ in its place. Armed
with this new term, they suggest a triadic structure as follows:

Thought or
Reference

Symbol

Referent

Figure 4: Ogden and Richards’s Triadic Model (Ogden and Richards 1989: 11).

In this model, ‘thought’ is positioned centrally and it ‘mediates’ between the
symbol and the referent, creating a ‘bridge’ between them. The ‘inspecting
mind’ effectively ‘translates’ one to the other (in either direction). The mediating role of the intellect is, consequently, interpretative in nature. It transforms
an object into a symbol or, conversely, it encounters a symbol and interprets it
by connecting it with a referent. The human mind is thus cast as an ‘encoder’
or ‘decoder’ of signs.
In the second work, Jappy’s ‘Introduction to Peircean Visual Semiotics’
(Jappy 2013), another triadic model is offered which also appears faithful to
Peirce. Here, the sign is positioned between the object and the interpretant.

94

6 Mediation in Peirce: The structure of the sign

Jappy, therefore, follows a conventional cognitive model; the sign is construed as a ‘special’ kind of sense impression – transmitted from the object to
the mind:

Object

Interpretant

Sign
Figure 5: Jappy’s Version of the Peircean Sign (Jappy 2013: 6).

It has already been noted that Jappy conflates the representamen with the sign
– hence the absence of this term in his diagram. But Jappy also views the triadic
sign as acting in a particular order: from object, to sign, to interpretant. This
places the object at the beginning of the signifying chain – it acts as a source of
the sign’s ‘transmission’. As a result, the sign becomes a semiotic mechanism
to obtain knowledge of a ‘noumenal’ object ‘behind’ it.
Elsewhere in the secondary literature, there are still other interpretations of
Peirce’s sign structure. Ma, for example, suggests that the interpretant should
be placed in the middle of the sign (rather than as the concluding element) and
this echoes the model of Ogden and Richards: “the mediatory effect of the interpretant in the sign-object relation is predicated on the meaning of a sign being
tied to the cultural, historical milieu within which the sign is understood” (Ma
2014: 379).
It is clear, therefore, that there is considerable uncertainty regarding even
the basic structure of Peirce’s sign. But in the light of our earlier discussion of
Hegel, it is now possible to suggest another way of understanding the Peircean
‘object’.
On an initial reading of Peirce, there seems to be ample evidence for interpretations such as Jappy’s. For example, Peirce states: “I will say that a sign is
anything, of whatsoever mode of being, which mediates between an object and
an interpretant; since it is both determined by the object relatively to the interpretant, and determines the interpretant in reference to the object, in such wise
as to cause the interpretant to be determined by the object through the mediation of this ‘sign’” (EP2: 410). But on further exploration, Peirce also says “I define a Sign as anything which is so determined by something else, called its

6.2 The ‘object’

95

Object, and so determines an effect upon a person, which effect I call its Interpretant, that the latter is thereby mediately determined by the former. My insertion of ‘upon a person’ is a sop to Cerberus, because I despair of making my
own broader conception understood [my italics]” (EP2: 478).
In the second passage, Peirce states that the object determines the sign, but
he then goes on to say that the interpretant is mediately determined by the object. This suggests that the object is in the middle of the sign – in between the
representamen and the interpretant. So why does Peirce also begin this passage
by clearly stating that the ‘sign’ is determined by the object? The solution to
this question resides in the fact that the object determines the meaning of the
sign through its mediating role. From its position within the sign, the object determines the interpretant. In this account, therefore, the whole sign structure
forms a triadic relationship that now places the ‘object’ in a mediating role.
Matters are made more complicated because the sign, as previously outlined in Figure 1, also has two dimensions. There is one dimension where the
sign is initially formed, and a second where it is employed by the intellect to
understand the world. In this second dimension, the sign is formed and can be
used to reference objects in a conventional sense. But this should not detract
from the fact that, in the first dimension, where the sign is still evolving, the
object should be placed in a mediating position.
So, what does the object do, in Peirce’s sign structure, if it is not transmitting the sign? Elsewhere, he states that “the sign stands for something, its object. It stands for that object, not in all respects, but in reference to a sort of
idea, which I have sometimes called the ground of the representamen” (CP2:
228). As already noted, the representamen is, critically, a ‘vague’. What Peirce
is suggesting, therefore, is that, in its formative stages, the sign takes an element of a ‘vague’ representamen and makes it ‘represent’ the ‘object’ in some,
but “not in all respects”. The object thus represents certain aspects of a ‘vague’
representamen. It constitutes an initial hypothesis – a guess at an identity –
which is a creation of the mind.
On this basis, the triadic relationships within the Peircean sign structure
appear very differently. The intellect perceives a representamen as a ‘vague’
and the ‘object’ (within the sign) is a posited response to it. On this basis, a
sign structure begins to form which leads to the creation of an interpretant and
completes the triadic relationship. In this process the object does, indeed, determine the sign, but not in a causal sense. It does so, instead, because it serves
to limit the initial vagueness of the representamen. The order between the three
elements of the Peircean sign, in its formative stage, can thus be revised as follows: representamen, object, interpretant. Critically, in this new framework, the
Peircean ‘object’ now becomes a mediating element within the sign.

96

6 Mediation in Peirce: The structure of the sign

As a result of this analysis, it is often useful to think about Peirce’s ‘object’
as being an ‘object of thought’. It does not act as a source of signification; rather
it is a mediating entity. As a result of this, and for the sake of clarity, the ‘object’
in the sign will often be described, in the rest of this essay, as an ‘object of
thought’ – unless, of course, the intention is to mean an object in the conventional sense.
It is recognised that this view of the ‘object’, within the Peircean sign, will
encounter criticism. But the argument, outlined above, is not based simply on a
particular interpretation of Peirce. It is also important to explore usage of the
term ‘object’ in the history of philosophy and to evaluate whether there is support for such a mediating role. Here substantial evidence can be found to support the argument that is being proposed.

6.3 Medieval, Kantian, and Hegelian accounts of the ‘object’
As a nineteenth century philosopher, Peirce is immersed in the works of medieval writers such as Duns Scotus (Boler 1963), as well as Kant and Hegel. A wide
spectrum of philosophers should thus be considered when evaluating how the
term ‘object’ has been used historically and how this might have influenced
Peirce. It can be shown, in fact, that the notion of the ‘object’ as a mediating
cognitive entity has deep historical roots. This usage of the term has medieval
origins, and it is still being used in this manner by Kant and Hegel in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. There are, as a result, several philosophical
sources influencing Peirce’s use of the term.
Perhaps the most effective way to understand Peirce’s use of the term is to
begin with Kant. In a famous passage in the ‘Critique of Pure Reason’, Kant
states (Kant 1998: 193–194):
It comes along with our nature that intuition can never be other than sensible, i.e., that
it contains only the way in which we are affected by objects. The faculty for thinking of
objects of sensible intuition, on the contrary, is the understanding. Neither of these
properties is to be preferred to the other. Without sensibility no object would be given to
us, and without understanding none would be thought. Thoughts without content are
empty, intuitions without concepts are blind.

Here, Kant speaks of “thinking of objects of sensible intuition” and he also
states that “without sensibility no object would be given to us, without understanding none would be thought”. Kant is clearly using the term ‘object’ here in
a different way to modern parlance; it is a mental entity that is employed in
acts of comprehension. And he also claims that human knowledge is created by

6.3 Medieval, Kantian, and Hegelian accounts of the ‘object’

97

a fusion of sensibility and understanding. He famously concludes that “thoughts
without content are empty, intuitions without concepts are blind”. Synthetic
knowledge cannot exist, Kant argues, without both elements being in place.
Stern (1990: 20) confirms this Kantian perspective when he states that:
The world of objects, in space and time do not have a ‘transcendental’ reality, but rather
must be grasped in a way that puts them inside our experience and allows them to be
explained within the conditions of experience.

This Kantian usage confirms that the ‘object’ can be viewed as a mediating role
that is neither exclusively extra-mental nor intra-mental. Rather, the ‘object’
synthesises both experiential and mental components. In this respect, it corresponds with the Peircean account of the ‘object’ outlined above. Peirce, in his
own writings, often uses the term in this Kantian manner. Examples can be
found at: CP1: 115; CP1: 132; CP2: 230; CP8: 15; CP3: 93; EP1: 7; EP1: 43; EP1: 46;
and EP1: 91. On some occasions, however, Peirce could not make his own usage
of the term ‘object’ any clearer (EP1: 90–91):
Indeed, what Kant called his Copernican step was precisely the passage from the nominalistic to the realistic view of reality. It was the essence of his philosophy to regard the
real object as determined by the mind. That was nothing else than to consider every conception and intuition which enters necessarily into the experience of an object, and
which is not transitory and accidental, as having objective validity. In short, it was to regard the reality as the normal product of mental action, and not as the incognizable cause
of it [my italics].

Peirce asserts here that the “real object” is determined by the mind and that
reality, as a result, is “the normal product of mental action”. In the same historical period as Kant, the Lithuanian philosopher Maimon also uses the term ‘object’ in the same manner. He explains the formation of what he calls ‘objects of
thought’ as follows (Maimon [1790] 2010: 30):
An object of thought is a concept of an object produced by the understanding according
to universal rules or conditions that therefore requires two parts: 1) Matter of thought, or
something given (intuition) whereby these universal rules or conditions are applied to a
determined object of thought (for they cannot [themselves] determine an object just because they are universal). 2) Form of Thought. i.e., these universal rules or conditions
themselves without which the given can still be an object (of intuition) but not an object
of thought: for thought is judging i.e., finding the universal in the particular or subsuming the particular under the universal.

A few decades later, Hegel also employs the term ‘object’ in the same manner:
“The real nature of the object is brought to light in reflection; but it is no less
true that this exertion of thought is my act. If this be so, the real nature is a
product of my mind, in its character of thinking subject . . . .” (Hegel 2014: 26).

98

6 Mediation in Peirce: The structure of the sign

And this Hegelian usage is fully explained by Inwood. He points out that Hegel,
in fact, uses two different words for ‘object’ which are sometimes mistakenly
translated as being equivalent to each other (Inwood 1992: 204):26
He [Hegel] stresses the etymology of Gegenstand more than that of Objekt, so that a Gegenstand is essentially and immediately an object of knowledge etc, whilst an Objekt is at
least initially independent. A Gegenstand is an intentional object whilst an Objekt is a
real object. . . . . A Gegenstand, by contrast, may be the object of a simple form of consciousness, such as sense certainty, which is not yet a fully-fledged subject.

It is clear from this that, whilst Peirce does sometimes speak of conventional
‘objects’, he also uses the term ‘object’ in the same way that Hegel uses the
word ‘Gegenstand’. Indeed, Inwood’s description of the latter as an “the object
of a simple form of consciousness” echoes Peircean usage. And, critically,
Hegel also maintains that a Gegenstand can change and grow. In his ‘Phenomenology of Spirit’, Hegel argues that when consciousness is confronted with reality, in an unexpected form, it is the ‘object of thought’ (the Gegenstand) that
evolves (Hegel 1977: 54):
If the comparison shows that these two moments do not correspond to one another, it
would seem that consciousness must alter its knowledge to make it conform to the object.
But, in fact, in the alteration of the knowledge, the object alters for it too, for the knowledge that was present was essentially a knowledge of the object: as the knowledge
changes, so too does the object, for it essentially belonged to this knowledge.

This analysis of Hegel’s object also corresponds to the two dimensions of the
sign highlighted in Figure 1. The evolving object within the sign is the Gegenstand; it is the object in the sign which is constantly changing. In contrast, the
Objekt (which stands, effectively, as an ultimate object of inquiry) is the object
upon which the Gegenstand is always trying to converge (as the sign becomes
more determinate). And this may well explain why Peirce uses the term ‘object’
in ways which confuse the modern reader.27

26 Caygill (1995: 305), in his ‘A Kant Dictionary’, notes that this failure to distinguish Gegenstand from Objekt occurs in several translations of Kant. He observes, for example, that
“Kant’s distinction between Gegenstand and Objekt is crucial to his transcendental philosophy, although never explicitly thematized and wholly obliterated in Kemp Smith’s translation
of the Critique of Pure Reason”.
27 This distinction between two kinds of ‘object’ can also be found in Deely. He distinguishes
‘objects’ and ‘things’ and argues that (Deely 2002: 136):
Now there is a great difference between an object and a thing, however confusedly the
two notions are made to play in popular culture. For while the notion of thing is the notion of what is what it is regardless of whether it be known or not, the notion of object is

6.3 Medieval, Kantian, and Hegelian accounts of the ‘object’

99

In the history of philosophy, this Kantian and Hegelian usage of the term
‘object’ can also be found in older philosophical sources. In the philosophy of
Duns Scotus, for example, individual sense data are the ‘objects’ of the senses
(e.g., colour is an ‘object’ of sight) (Lagerlund 2007). Thus, to understand an
‘object’, as it exists, it is necessary to have an additional, and mediating, ‘object’, which forms within the mind, and which allows an object to be comprehended. As Pasnau explains, it is this second ‘object’ that, in fact, renders
something cognizable (Pasnau 2002: 289):
He [Scotus] gladly allows that the external object is present – that it has real presence –
and that it is the efficient cause of the cognitive act. Still Scotus insists that this is not
enough to account for cognition. Another kind of presence is needed, the presence of the
object-as-cognized.

Elsewhere, Maritain also describes how the early modern philosopher, Poinsot,
uses the term ‘object’ (Maritain 1995: 416):
The concept is a mediator; by and in it the object is brought into the womb of the mind in
the state of ultimate intellectual actuation. Thus, our intellect attains things only according as its concepts render them present to it. The manner of our understanding corresponds to the more-or-less complete, or the more-or-less defective way in which the thing
is objectified in the concept.

And there are occasions when Peirce explicitly confirms that he is adopting this
medieval usage. In a letter to Lady Welby, for example, he explains “I use the
term ‘object’ in the sense in which objectum was first made a substantive early
in the XIIIth century; and when I use the word without adding ‘of’ what I am
speaking of the object, I mean anything that comes before thought or the mind
in any usual sense” (SS: 69).
However, if this revised construal of the term ‘object’ is accepted, this still
leaves an important question unanswered; what is the relationship between the
representamen and the ‘object of thought’ in the sign? This raises the issue of
what Peirce means by the verb ‘determine’. As already discussed, it does not
involve initiation or causation. So, what does Peirce mean by it?

hardly that. An object, to be an object, requires a relation to a knower, in and through
which relation the object as apprehended exists as terminus. A sign warning of ‘bridge
out’ may be a lie, but the thing in question, even in such a case, is no less objective than
in the case where the sign warns of a ‘true situation’.
A ‘thing’, for Deely, therefore, largely corresponds to the Hegelian Objekt, whilst Deely’s ‘object’ equates to Hegel’s Gegenstand.

6 Mediation in Peirce: The structure of the sign

6.4 The determination of the object
Peirce often employs the verb ‘determine’ in his definitions of the sign and several instances of this have already been cited. A common view, however, is that
Peirce’s notion of ‘determination’ involves causation; an object determines a
sign because it causes it to be transmitted to a perceiver. But the term, in fact,
has a very specific meaning for Peirce which, again, is inherited from Hegel.
Here is another example of his use of the term, along with an indication (significantly in German this time) of what ‘determination’ may mean (EP2: 492):
A Sign is a Cognizable that, on the one hand, is so determined (i.e., specialized, bestimmt)
by something other than itself, called its Object . . . . while, on the other hand, it so determines some actual or potential Mind, the determination whereof I term the Interpretant created by the Sign, that that Interpreting Mind is therein determined mediately by the Object.

It is noteworthy, here, that Peirce again places the ‘object’ in a mediating role;
the “Interpreting Mind is therein determined mediately by the Object”. However, such passages can also be read as suggesting that ‘determined’ means
caused. It has been noted that Jappy views the sign as being transmitted by the
object, but there are many other instances of this construal. De Waal (2013: 87),
for example, claims that the object “compels the sign”. Likewise, Hookway,
seeking to explain the Peircean ‘object’, uses a particular example of a sign:
“the stripped bark, here, is the sign; as its object we can take the deer or the
fact that there have been deer nearby; and the interpretant is our thought that
there are deer nearby” (Hookway 1985: 122). Here Hookway construes the deer
as the cause of the bark being stripped. The word ‘determination’ suggests that
he is discussing a cause of the sign.
Short, however, is more nuanced in his discussion of ‘determination’. He
recognises the importance of the term to Peirce and devotes several pages to its
meaning. He correctly identifies that “there is considerable trouble over how
the relation of object to sign and of sign to interpretant is to be conceived”
(Short 2007: 165). Crucially, he notes, in line with the passage above, that the
word Peirce often uses is the German term ‘bestimmen’ (or ‘specialized’) and
that its meaning is “to limit as in, ‘the water’s edge determines where your
property ends’” (Short 2007: 167). He concludes, as a result, that “each object
limits, or determines, what may be a sign of it, and each sign similarly determines what may be an interpretant of it”. His interpretation thus construes the
notion of ‘determination’ as specifying the scope of the possible meanings of
the sign. This is closer to a correct understanding of the term ‘determine’, but
Short has still not made a connection to the indeterminateness of perception.

6.4 The determination of the object

101

He still adheres to the view that an object causes a sign, but he believes that
such an object ‘limits’ what possible sign this could be.
Given our earlier discussion of Peircean cognition, however, we are in a
much better position to grasp Peirce’s intentions. Because he contends that
human perception is intrinsically indeterminate, it follows that the ‘object’ now
has a clear role to play in the structure of the sign. It encapsulates (as an evolving
hypothesis) a more ‘determined’ identity compared with the original ‘vague’ representamen. In other words, the object limits the scope of the representamen.
This process is never exhaustive enough to make a particular ‘object of thought’
completely determinate (an absolute representation of reality itself), but the activity still renders an object (of thought) more and more determinate. This is the
activity that constitutes concept formation. As Peirce states “. . . thoughts are determinations of the mind” (CP4: 582).
It is important, however, to understand how this process takes place within
the sign. Helpfully, one of Peirce’s editors corresponded with him on this subject. Peirce clarified his position in a letter entitled ‘What is Meant by Determined’. Peirce states, explicitly referencing Hegel, that (W 1982 Vol 2: 155–6):
Perhaps, therefore, I shall do well to state more fully than I did before, the manner in
which I understand Hegel (in common with all other logicians) to use them. Possibly, the
original signification of bestimmt was ‘settled by vote’; or it may have been ‘pitched to a
key’. Thus, its origin was quite different from that of ‘determined’, yet I believe that as
philosophical terms their equivalence is exact. In general, they mean ‘fixed to be this (or
thus), in contradistinction to being this, that, or the other (or in some way or other)

The meaning of ‘determination’ is, therefore, linked, for Peirce, to the idea of
‘fixing’. When the representamen is ‘determined’ by the ‘object’, the latter
specifies, or ‘limits’, the former and ‘fixes’ it as being one thing rather than another. This reflects the idea of ‘limiting’ highlighted by Short above. Elsewhere,
Peirce also describes ‘determination’ as the activity of adding “depth” to a sign
as it becomes more specified. As Liszka notes (Liszka 1996: 70):
Reasoning processes that are focused primarily on the increase or decrease in depth, respectively, are called determination and depletion. Determination is the process of reasoning by which we add greater and greater depth, more and more predicates to a particular
subject (CP2: 422). A complete determination would involve a display of all the predicates
that apply to some subject.

Therefore, as predicates are added to an ‘object of thought’, and it becomes
more embedded in the world, it also becomes more ‘determined’. And how is it
decided which predicates are included, or not included, in a specific concept?
This is achieved through the action of secondness which either further determines an existing concept or forces the mind to create a new one. In respect of

102

6 Mediation in Peirce: The structure of the sign

the latter, Peirce asserts that, “a genus characterised by Reaction will, by determination of its essential character, split into two species, one a species where
secondness is strong, the other a species where the secondness is weak, and
the strong species will subdivide into two that will be similarly related, without
any corresponding subdivision of the weak species” (CP5: 69).
In line with this argument, it is also useful to highlight that the notion of
‘determination’ was widespread in the eighteenth century in relation to concept
formation. Maimon employs the same term and sees it as the mechanism which
refines human concepts. He argues (2010: 21) that “sensibility thus provides the
differentials to a determined consciousness; out of them, the imagination produces a finite (determined) object of intuition”. And we also find that Kant employs the same term in his ‘Critique of Pure Reason’. For example, he argues
that: “Every concept, in regard to what is not contained in it, is indeterminate,
and stands under the principle of determinability” (Kant 1998: 553).
Peirce, therefore, when he uses the verb determine, is following a well-established philosophical tradition. In line with his predecessors, he views ‘determination’ as the mechanism which drives the evolution of a concept. It is, in
fact, the very process which creates a ‘natural history of the sign’. And, critically, this semiotic activity takes place within the sign as an ‘object of thought’
is progressively limited by new empirical experiences.
To summarise, therefore, in the ‘speculative’ stage of Peircean sign formation, the mind creates an ‘object of thought’ as it hypotheses the existence of an
identity within the perceptual continuum. This mediating entity, once formed, is
where further development then takes place as it becomes steadily more determined. As with Hegel, the ‘object of thought’ starts its life as a hypothesis, and it
remains provisional because reality can always force revisions of it. In this evolutionary activity, determinations previously included in the ‘object of thought’ are
reinforced, further limited in their scope, or the impact of reality (via secondness)
forces the mind to invoke a completely new ‘object of thought’. And, as a result,
and contra Saussure, reality has a role in determining the content of a concept.

6.5 Immediate and dynamic objects
As an ‘object of thought’ becomes more determined, it becomes progressively
more approximated to reality. In this activity of sign development, experiential
inputs and the mental faculties combine to form a synthetic unity within the
sign. As Andacht states “in experience the external and the internal come together through sign mediation in an evolving mixture of error and truth that
only time, and self-criticism, are able to refine” (Andacht 2014: 15). This is why

6.5 Immediate and dynamic objects

103

Peirce calls himself an “objective idealist” (EP1: 293), and why, as highlighted
above, he insists on the pivotal role of secondness. It is this category of being
that leads him to reject the “absolute idealism” of Hegel (EP2: 177; Lane 2018: 70)
As an ‘object of thought’ becomes more determined it also develops more
complexity. This means that it is possible to differentiate between an ‘object of
thought’, as initially conceived, and when it has developed more specificity. In
the later part of his career, Peirce makes a useful distinction between ‘objects
of thought’ on this basis. An ‘immediate object’ is the one formed initially,
whilst the ‘dynamic object’ is the ‘object of thought’ in its more developed complexity. Because experience can only provide part of the relational continuum
of the Phaneron, it follows that a developing ‘object of thought’ can always be
experienced from more perspectives. It is these which drive the evolving ‘dynamic object’.
This approach to human knowledge is, of course, one that has already been
encountered. For Leibniz, human beings possess only a limited understanding of
reality and their knowledge admits of degrees. Only God knows the entire relational web of the universe. In this context, Leibniz called these partial levels of
understanding ‘nominal definitions’. These are, of course, always provisional
and they can be revised in the light of new experience. In his ‘New Essays Concerning Human Understanding’ Leibniz states that (Leibniz 1996: 299–300):
So, there is a kind of redundancy in our perceptions of sensible qualities as well as of
sensible portions of matter: it consists in the fact that we have more than one notion of a
single subject. Gold can be nominally defined in various ways – it can be called the heaviest body we have, the most malleable, a fusible body which resists cupellation and aquafortis, etc. Each of these marks is sound, and suffices for the recognition of gold:
provisionally, at least, and in the present state of the bodies around us . . . . . . . . So, one
can say . . . . . . . . that in matters where we have only the empiric’s kind of knowledge
our definitions are all merely provisional.

This is the same distinction Peirce makes between ‘immediate’ and ‘dynamic’
objects. He distinguishes the ‘object of thought’, as it is partially known, from
the ‘object of thought’ as it could be known in the long run. There is, of course,
an implicit dualism here, but it is of very different kind to that of ‘secondary
dualism’. The latter distinguishes between known sense data and the mind’s interpretation of them. Peirce’s distinction, in contrast, simply differentiates between partial and more complete understandings. And this difference is a
direct consequence of his belief that the mind is immersed in a relational
universe.
This Leibnizian framework also means, of course, that Peirce believes that
signs have potential as well as actual meanings (EP2: 404). In a system in
which entities are defined by their relationships with each other, it follows that

104

6 Mediation in Peirce: The structure of the sign

everything is potentially knowable from every other position in that system. In
this respect, Peirce views the ‘immediate object’ as providing only a hint of the
‘dynamic’ object. In a letter to Lady Welby, he states (EP2: 480):
It is usual and proper to distinguish two Objects of a Sign, the Mediate without, and the
Immediate within the Sign. Its Interpretant is all that the Sign conveys: acquaintance
with its Object must be gained by collateral experience. The Mediate Object is the Object
outside of the Sign; I call it the Dynamoid Object. The Sign must indicate it by a hint; and
this hint, or its substance, is the Immediate Object.

By insisting that the developing (dynamic) object is ‘mediate’ (because it is mediated), Peirce emphasises that “acquaintance” with it “must be gained by collateral experience”. Such experience allows a closer understanding of what the
‘object of thought’ might be. But Peirce also insists that this ‘dynamic object’
does not equate to a ‘noumenal’ reality ‘behind’ the immediate object. In another letter, this time to James, he explains that he has deliberately not called
the dynamic object the ‘real’ object (EP2: 498):
We must distinguish between the Immediate Object, – i.e., the Object as represented in
the Sign, – and the Real (no, because perhaps the Object is altogether fictive, I must
choose a different term; therefore:), say rather the Dynamical Object, which, from the nature of things, the Sign cannot express, which it can only indicate and leave the interpreter to find out by collateral experience.

The ‘dynamical object’ is thus the ‘object of thought’ in its relational richness.
It is what a human mind would know if it were either omniscient, or if it could
consider an object from all perspectives.28 It is, of course, significant that Peirce
is tempted to use the term “real”’ to describe the ‘dynamic’ object, but he decides to avoid this term because he knows that it will be interpreted dualistically. And in a letter to Lady Welby (EP2: 478), Peirce goes out of his way to
state that, “By the way, the dynamical object does not mean something out of
the mind. It means something forced upon the mind in perception but including more than perception reveals”.
Many commentators, however, do not fully appreciate Peirce’s desire to
avoid this dualistic trap, and, falling into it themselves, conclude that he now
acknowledges an ‘objective’ reality. Short, for instance, in an excellent analysis
of the ‘dynamic’ object, still concludes that “the dynamic object is exactly that
about which more can be learned. Therefore, it must be independent of our

28 This point is also echoed by Deleuze, in his discussion of Leibniz (Deleuze 2006: 23), when
he discusses perspectivism and relativity and speaks of “perspectivism as a truth of relativity
(and not a relativity of what is true)”.

6.5 Immediate and dynamic objects

105

experience of it” (Short 2007: 199). Here Short slips from the correct view that
the mind enjoys incomplete experience of the ‘dynamic’ object, to the more
questionable conclusion that it must be “independent” of the mind. He does
not recognise Peirce’s assumption that the intellect is immersed in a relational
reality and enjoys, as a result, only partial understanding. Short consequently
concludes that Peirce is forced back to a type of idealism and suggests that “we
are back to idealism again, semiotic idealism specifically” (Short 2007: 191).
This reluctance to recognise that Peirce’s rejection of dualism is compatible
with the ‘dynamic object’ also emerges with other commentators. Liszka, for example, clearly explains the ‘immediate’ object, but, picking up on the idea of
‘dynamism’, focuses on the idea of compulsion when discussing the ‘dynamic
object’. This supports his ‘transmission’ interpretation of the sign: “the dynamic object can be considered as the dynamism, the machine that drives the
semiotic process; it is what compels the sign” (Liszka 1996: 21). Indeed, Liszka
goes on to illustrate this version of sign action with a diagram (Liszka 1996: 32)
that places the ‘dynamic object’ at the beginning of the signification process.
Elsewhere, Deledalle also appears to misunderstand Peirce on this point. He
correctly notes that knowledge of the ‘dynamic’ object is gained by “collateral
experience” but argues that such knowledge cannot form “direct knowledge of
the dynamical object” itself. Deledalle (2000: 46) concludes, in dualistic fashion,
that:
We must, therefore, unless we fall back into idealism, admit the existence of an ‘external’
object: the dynamical object, which is ‘as it is regardless of any particular aspect of it, the
Object in such relations as unlimited and final study would show it to be’ (CP8.183). What
is known is thus the relations of an existing object independent of ourselves in the course
of the semioses in which we are, it and ourselves, engaged.

Like Short, Deledalle has here conflated the fact that human understanding
lacks complete knowledge of a ‘dynamical object’ with the idea that it is “independent of ourselves”. He concludes that this re-instates a form of ‘idealism’ –
adopting a dualistic position. And Proni also asserts that Peirce’s ‘dynamical’
object must invoke Kant’s noumenal reality: “the Dynamical Object is that
which puts the whole process in motion, standing behind the scenes, unreachable in its completeness (as in Ding an Sich in Kant), but effective in its empirical existence” (Proni 2015: 19). And finally, Greenlee also reaches the same
conclusion, arguing that the ‘dynamical’ object has ‘noumenal’ characteristics:
“the dynamical object is the represented thing, as it is in itself, apart from relation to thought, while that same thing, brought into relation to thought, is the
‘immediate’ object [my italics]” (Greenlee 1973: 66).

106

6 Mediation in Peirce: The structure of the sign

But the ‘dynamical’ object, immersed in the web of the universe, is simply
the end point towards which an ‘object of thought’ is constantly evolving. It is
not something “apart from relation to thought”. Commentators, therefore, fail
to recognise Peirce’s rejection of dualism and conclude that his ‘dynamic’ object entails an implicit adherence to this doctrine. Peirce argues, in contrast,
that the ‘object of thought’ grows in the sign, and as it does so, it encapsulates
evolving human understanding.29 As such, the ‘dynamic object’ is not set apart
from thought. Indeed, it is precisely what connects the mind to the universe in
which it is immersed.

6.6 The interpretant
The interpretant is the third element in the Peircean sign and, again, it is the
subject of debate in the secondary literature – and not simply because of the
term Peirce chose for it. Critically, it must be recognised that Peirce uses the
term ‘interpretant’ precisely because he wants to ensure that his sign structure
does not slip back into ‘secondary dualism’. For Peirce, the interpretant is not
an ‘interpretation’ of a ‘sign vehicle’ observed on the ‘mirror’ of the mind. Instead, it acts in another way – as an ‘interpreter’ which transforms or translates
an existing identity into a new identity. As a result, it is critical to understand
Peirce’s distinction between the interpretation and transformation. As Skagestad (2004: 244) observes:
It is essential to note that the interpretant of the sign is not identical to the interpreter;
i.e., the individual mind interpreting the sign is not one of the three references that constitute signhood.

There are many commentators, however, who view the interpretant as either an
interpretation of the sign, or the ‘effect’ on a perceiver that takes place through

29 Stjernfelt concurs with this picture of how human knowledge grows, but instead of viewing
it through the growth of an ‘object of thought’ (within the sign), he maintains that human
knowledge grows through increasingly accurate iconic representations (Stjernfelt 2007: 88):
[The other reason is that] any icon fails to portray its object with final precision; this possibility is only asymptotically open for the community of researchers. This, of course, is
Peirce’s answer by means of continuity to Kant’s Ding-an-Sich, it may be reached, but
only in an indefinite future. But this implies that given any present icon, it is always in
principle possible to find an even better icon which will then yield more evidence than
the former. Thus, as a consequence of both these reasons, iconic evidence is always
relative.

6.6 The interpretant

107

the interpretation of a sign. Both solutions result, however, in a psychological
understanding of the interpretant which Peirce is keen to avoid. Peirce certainly
discusses the effects of the interpretant when he distinguishes between the
‘emotional’, ‘energetic’ and ‘logical’ interpretants, but it is important to first establish the status of the interpretant itself.
It has already been observed that the representamen has an ‘indeterminate’
nature and that the role of the evolving ‘object of thought’ is to encapsulate
greater specifications of it. At a certain point in semiosis, however, Peirce maintains that the interpretant transforms the emerging ‘object of thought’ into a
‘third’. It is at this point that a ‘genuine sign’ is formed which can be used to
understand the world. This is possible because the interpretant creates a new
identity. So how, exactly, does the interpretant achieve this task?
In his ‘On a New List of Categories’, Peirce suggests, in an extended passage
with several examples, that the interpretant has, in fact, little to do with interpretation (EP1: 5):
Suppose we wish to compare the letters p and b. We may imagine one of them to be
turned over on the line of writing as an axis, then laid upon the other, and finally to become transparent so that the other can be seen through it. In this way we shall form a
new image which mediates between the images of the two letters, inasmuch as it represents one of them to be (when turned over) the likeness of the other.

Peirce thus asserts that a new and mediating image is created which “represents
one of them to be the likeness of the other”. This image does not ‘interpret’ the
first image; rather it states that there is an equivalence between the two. Peirce
goes on to say in the same passage (EP1: 5):
Again, suppose we think of a murderer as being in relation to a murdered person: in this
case we conceive the act of the murder, and in this conception, it is represented that corresponding to every murderer (as well as to every murder) there is a murdered person;
and thus we resort again to a mediating representation which represents the relate as
standing for a correlate with which the mediating representation is itself in relation. ... .
By a further accumulation of instances, it would be found that every comparison requires,
besides the related thing, the ground, and the correlate, also a mediating representation
which represents the relate to be a representation of the same correlate which this mediating representation itself represents. Such a mediating representation may be termed an interpretant, because it fulfils the office of an interpreter, who says that a foreigner says the
same thing which he himself says.

Here, again, Peirce suggests that a similar structure forms an interpretant. The
key sentence refers to “a mediating representation which represents the relate
to be a representation of the same correlate which this mediating representation itself represents”. And it is one that certainly needs unpacking. Peirce is
asserting that the “mediating representation” (e.g., the interpretant) equates to

108

6 Mediation in Peirce: The structure of the sign

“the same correlate which this mediating representation itself represents”. In
other words, the interpretant is the entity within the sign which asserts that a
given representamen is the same as a given ‘object of thought’. This assertion
of equivalence means that the perceived representamen is now raised to the
level of a ‘third’. In the case of ‘murder’ the interpretant, therefore, asserts that
the experience presented to a perceiver equates to the ‘object of thought’ (the
notion of ‘murder’) and that these are now equivalent to each other. A ‘third’
(or ‘genuine sign’) is thus formed which says to the perceiver that he, or she, is
now confronted with an ‘act of murder’. The interpretant thus transforms, or
translates, the initial representamen and it insists, like the interpreter of a foreign language, that a particular experience is, in fact, the same identity as the
‘object of thought’ in the sign.
It may be objected, at this point, that the Peircean interpretant cannot represent a form of objective human knowledge. Simply asserting that an equivalence exists within the sign is not the same as ‘knowing’ something. However,
it must be remembered that Peirce is not seeking to establish ‘objective’ knowledge through his semiotic system. His doctrine of ‘fallibilism’ means that the
intellect cannot entertain certainty of this kind. All that it seeks to achieve is to
‘fix’ belief. Indeed, this feature suggests that the Peircean interpretant has a
strong Hegelian character. It parallels the convergence of an ‘object of thought’
(a Hegelian Gegenstand) and a particular experience of the world (a Hegelian
Objekt). It is this convergence, within the sign, that underpins an interpretant
and furnishes the intellect with knowledge that an object will behave in a particular way. Earlier, this same phenomenon is also encountered in Schelling. In
the very first paragraph of his ‘System of Transcendental Idealism’ he states that
(Schelling 1800/1978: 5)
All knowledge is founded upon the coincidence of an objective with a subjective, – For
we know only what is true; but truth is generally taken to consist in the coincidence of
presentations with their objects.

It is this convergence of objects (of thought) with their “presentations” (e.g.,
sense data) that forms the foundation of truth for Schelling.
The underlying structure of the Peircean interpretant also has clear origins
in Kant. The latter’s notion of the ‘transcendental schema’ displays the similar
characteristics. For example, Kant (1998: 272) states that:
Now it is clear that there must be a third thing, which must stand in homogeneity with
the category on the one hand and the appearance on the other and makes possible the
application of the former to the latter. This mediating representation must be pure (without anything empirical) and yet intellectual on the one hand and sensible on the other.
Such a representation is the transcendental schema.

6.6 The interpretant

109

This description of the ‘transcendental schema’ echoes the Peircean interpretant because it operates through a “homogeneity” existing across two categories. (e.g., the ‘sensible’ and the ‘intellectual’). It is this convergence which
Peirce references in his discussion of the interpretant. This conclusion is also
confirmed by Murphey (1993: 86) who argues that:
From this position it follows that the unity of the manifold is produced by the referring of
the impressions to an object by the interpretant . . . . . . . . Are we then to believe that the
present in general is compared to a second substance which is also its object? This would
require that there be already in consciousness a ‘substance’ possessing the same property
as the given substance yet designated by it. This, I believe is what Peirce is saying.

Murphey therefore concludes that an interpretant is formed when the mind
makes a comparison between ‘the present in general’ and a ‘second substance’
(e.g., an ‘object of thought’) which is ‘already in consciousness’.
And returning to Schelling, he also adopts, following Kant, a similar model
with his ‘transcendental schema’. He states that (Schelling 1978:143):30
Hence the transcendental schema will have to be explained as that which mediates most
fundamentally between inner and outer sense.

This account of the interpretant suggests, therefore, that the role of this third
element of the Peircean sign is to assert an equivalence between the representamen and the evolving ‘object of thought’ in the sign. And this, importantly,
also elucidates our earlier account of sublation. An interpretant, as highlighted
above, asserts that a particular representamen represents a new (and ‘higher’)
identity whilst at the same time insisting that they are one and the same thing.
This, it is clear, is sublation in action. The purely experiential element in the
sign (e.g., the representamen) is ‘preserved’ within the sign whilst, at the same
time, it is also ‘lifted up’ to form a ‘third’. As such, the interpretant creates a
new identity which now involves seeing something as something else. And this
is precisely how Peirce construes a ‘third’. He is not suggesting, therefore, that
a psychologically based interpretation takes place within his triadic sign, but
rather that a new identity is created by the sign which now has existence (and
meaning) in the world.

30 Schelling, in fact, has two notions of the schema. The first of these is the ‘empirical
schema’ which seems to equate to Peirce’s icon. Schelling states that “the empirical schema
was explained as the sensorily intuited rule whereby an object can be brought forth empirically” (Schelling 1978: 143). He contrasts this with the transcendental schema which “combines the inner and outer sense” (Schelling 1978: 143).

110

6 Mediation in Peirce: The structure of the sign

The emergence of the interpretant can be outlined in diagrammatic terms
(Figure 6). This diagram demonstrates that the interpretant establishes an
equivalence between two categories – the ‘sensible’ and the ‘intellectual’.
There are thus two categories involved in the creation of a genuine sign. The
first of these is the representamen; the second the ‘object of thought’. The exact
relationship between these two categories will be analysed in more detail, in
chapter ten, when the inter-relationships between the three categories and the
three elements of the sign are discussed. However, in Figure 6, the overall trajectory of the triadic sign can still be identified. Firstly, a simple representamen
is formed; secondly, an ‘object of thought’ is created and developed, and,
thirdly, the interpretant brings these together in a way which asserts that they
are the same perceived identity, but now ‘raised’ to a higher level of meaning.

And to bring our discussion back to Hegel, we find that he describes the sign
itself in the same terms. Hegel states that (Hegel 1830/1894: 458):
It is this unity (initiated by intelligence) of an independent representation with an intuition, the matter of the latter is, in the first instance, something accepted, somewhat

6.6 The interpretant

111

immediate or given (e.g., the colour of the cockade etc). But in the fusion of the two elements, the intuition does not count positively or as representing itself, but as representative of something else. It is an image, which has received as its soul and meaning an
independent mental representation. This intuition is the Sign.

In this Hegelian account, the mind has an initial sensation of something “immediate or given”, but in forming a sign this element “does not count positively
or as representing itself”. Instead, it becomes “representative of something
else” – a sign. It remains an ‘intuition’, but the sense datum is elevated to represent new meaning.
What is of great significance for Peirce is the fact that the interpretant (like
a Kantian schema) crosses over between two categories.31 In doing so, it creates
a new identity which subsumes the indexical components which were originally
present in the emerging of ‘object of thought’. As such, it transforms their status; these indexical associations now become signs of the new (and higher)
identity.
To observe how this works in practice, an example can be considered. This
shows how a visual representamen, and its indexical associations, can be sublated into a higher identity. I can observe, for instance, some yellow cars in
New York City, and I can initially form an ‘object of thought’ based on their
similarity to each other (e.g., an icon). Over time, I can also form indexical associations with this icon (e.g., these yellow cars are found in Times Square, near
Central Park etc). When I form a ‘third’, however, these indexical associations
are given a new status – the yellow cars now become signs of New York. If I
encounter them again, or see them in a film, they make me think of that city. A
critical inversion has thus taken place within the concept. The indexical elements (which were once just associative in nature) are now included in the

31 Crucially, it seems that it is the ability of the schema to subsume two different categories
under the same heading that renders it ‘transcendental’ in nature. This view is confirmed in
medieval uses of the term ‘transcendental’ which show that it entails an ability to operate
across categories. This is clearly different from the modern meaning of the term which involves
the notion of something being beyond the ‘phenomenal’ and belonging to the ‘noumenal’
world. In this modern construal the term ‘transcendental’, therefore, means the opposite of
‘empirical’, whilst for Kant (and probably also for Peirce) it involves the ability to work across
heterogenous categories. In an online article entitled ‘Medieval Theories of Transcendentals’,
Wouter Goris and Jan Aertsen (2019), state that “since especially the Kantian understanding of
the transcendental has been influenced for the modern mind, it must be emphasised at the
outset that the medieval understanding is not opposed to the empirical, but to the categorical”. This construal of the transcendental as working across categories is confirmed by Deely
who observes that “‘transcendental’ became the accepted medieval term for any notion that
applies to more than one category, or that is verified in every category” (Deely 2010: 101).

6 Mediation in Peirce: The structure of the sign

newly formed ‘object of thought’. Maimon, a contemporary of Kant, in a passage interestingly entitled “On Symbolic Cognition and Philosophical Language”,
captures this semiotic nexus when he states, rather elliptically, that (Maimon
2010: 142):
As a result, an object of symbolic cognition is: a form, or way, of thinking an object of
intuition, that is itself treated as an object (but not of intuition).

This comment by Maimon explains, once more, how a ‘third’ is formed. An interpretant (an ‘object of symbolic cognition’) is a way “of thinking an objection
of intuition” (e.g., a representamen) in a manner that treats it as a (mediating)
object in its own right (e.g., a ‘third’ and not simply an intuition).
Earlier in this essay, it was also noted that Leibniz’s monads have a set of
characteristics that differentiate them from modern accounts of identity. It was
emphasised that monads do not separately exist and then have relationships
with each other; rather they are identities which are defined by their relationships with each other. As such, Leibniz’s monadic identities include their indexical relationships with the world. This insight is now reflected in Peirce’s sign
structure. The indexical associations that were present in the emerging ‘object
of thought’ are now subsumed (via sublation) in the new identity of the interpretant. In this position they have a new status; they become the entailments of
the newly formed identity. In many respects, therefore, the Peircean interpretant echoes the earlier unity of the Leibnizian monad. Sublation has allowed a
fusion to take place in which the new identity includes its indices and they, in
turn, become signs of the identity.
Later in his career, Peirce makes further distinctions between different
types of interpretant. Firstly, he distinguishes between ‘immediate’, ‘dynamic’
and ‘final’ interpretants (CP8: 314). These reflect the extent to which an interpretant is known to the person forming the sign and these distinctions correspond to the immediate and dynamic objects discussed above. Secondly, Peirce
also distinguishes three types of interpretant which reflect his experiential categories. The identity of the interpretant, can be experienced, therefore, as a
‘first’ (as an “emotional interpretant”), as a ‘second’ (as an “energetic interpretant” that acts upon the observer), or as a ‘third’ (as a “logical interpretant”
with logical entailments) (CP5: 475–476). These distinctions may suggest that
Peirce is advocating a psychological account of the interpretant. But, in fact, he
is simply indicating how it is experienced through his three categories of being.
To summarise, the interpretant is the final element of Peirce’s sign and, as
such, it completes the triadic relationship. When sign formation reaches the
stage of the ‘third’ a new identity is established which exists in the world. It is
still experienced as an immediate sense datum, but it has now acquired new

6.6 The interpretant

113

meaning. A clock is thus experienced as a clock and not as a complicated combination of pieces of metal. This ‘third’, or ‘genuine sign’, now contains logical
entailments which inform us how it relates to the world.
And, as noted above, this triadic framework parallels Hegel’s account of
concept formation as it ascends from Being to Essence to Notion. This dialectical activity also concludes with an act of sublation in which the immediate sensory experience is annulled (because it is no longer treated as it appears) and is
yet ‘preserved’ and ‘lifted up’ to a higher level – as a new identity in the world.
As such, Peirce’s parallel account of the interpretant explains the formation of
a ‘genuine’ sign which now stands for something else.

7 Mediation in Vygotsky: ‘Word meaning’
In the previous chapter it was noted that one of the key barriers to understanding
Peirce, and the extent of Hegel’s influence on him, is the fact that his notion of
‘mediation’ has been misconstrued by modern commentators. They tend to assume the Peircean ‘object’ is the source of the sign, and, in these circumstances,
it ceases to be a mediating ‘object of thought’ evolving within the sign. In this interpretation, Peirce’s sign theory is reduced to a semiotic version of ‘secondary
dualism’ and is reliant on interpretation as a mechanism for meaning creation.
But Vygotsky’s own account of concept formation must now be evaluated.
Here similar mistakes can be found regarding the notion of mediation, and these
also originate in a reluctance to recognise Hegel’s influence. Vygotsky’s account
of mediation is frequently converted, as a result, into versions of social constructivism. Insufficient emphasis is given, therefore, to his notion of ‘word meaning’
and commentators highlight, instead, his focus on speech and words, viewing
these as suitable platforms for their constructivist accounts. In contrast, for Vygotsky, ‘word meaning’ is a form of synthetic knowledge that closely aligns with
Hegel. However, to begin with, it is important to outline how Vygotsky’s writings
reflect Hegel’s dialectical account of concept formation.

7.1 Dialectical psychology
It is widely acknowledged that Vygotsky borrows from the dialecticism of Hegel
(Van der Veer and Valsiner 1991: 26–27). However, Vygotsky’s own dialectical
thought is often misunderstood in ways that undermine his intentions. In particular, there is a tendency, within the secondary literature, to shift the focus
on dialecticism away from purely cognitive processes (which are more Hegelian
in character), and towards a form of social dialecticism between individuals. In
this context, Vygotsky’s dialecticism ceases to be an account of mental activity
and becomes a description of social dynamics.
But Vygotsky does, in fact, adopt the Hegelian template at a cognitive
level. Vygotsky describes his ‘third system’ as being distinct from the purely experiential inputs of ‘natural perception’. Vygotsky establishes this point, stating
that (Vygotsky 1997b: 21):
The system of activity of the child is determined at each given step by both the degree of
his organic development and the degree of his mastery of tools. The two different systems
develop jointly, forming, in essence, a third system, a new system of a unique type.

7.1 Dialectical psychology

115

In advocating this ‘third system’, Vygotsky proposes that psychologists adopt
an approach which transcends the “animalization of child psychology” (Vygotsky and Luria 1994: 101) and he calls his own narrative “dialectical psychology”
(Vygotsky 1997a: 114):
Dialectical psychology’s whole uniqueness precisely resides in the attempt to define the
subject matter of its study in a completely novel way. This subject matter is the integral
process of behaviour which is characterised by the fact that it has its mental and physiological side. [Dialectical] psychology studies it as a unitary and integral process and only
in this tries to find a way out of the blind alley that was created.

Moreover, Vygotsky sees this ‘third system’ as explicitly rejecting dualism (Vygotsky 1997a: 112):
Dialectical psychology proceeds first of all from the unity of mental and physiological
processes. Because for dialectical psychology mind is not, in the words of Spinoza, something that is situated outside nature or as a kingdom within a kingdom, it is part of nature
itself, directly linked to the functions of the higher organised matter of our brain.

This account of Vygotsky’s dialectical psychology can be contrasted with modern commentaries. These often fail to recognise that dialecticism, for Vygotsky,
involves this ‘third system’ and, instead, they assume that Vygotsky is concerned with social interactions between individuals. Ma, for example, talks of
“how mind and culture shape each other dialectically” (Ma 2014: 377) and Lee
construes Vygotsky’s dialecticism (C. Lee 2005: 254) as follows:
The use of language as both a socially communicative act and a medium for internal organisation of experience requires a give and take, a dialectical interaction among interlocutors. Wertsch calls this dialectical dialogue semiotic mediation.

Equally, Bidell, comparing Vygotsky with Piaget, views the dialecticism of Vygotsky in social terms: “Vygotsky presents a dialectical conception of relations between the personal and the social . . . .” (Bidell 1992: 308). And this thinking is
extended to include the idea of social participation. He argues that “Vygotskian
scholars over the years have successfully introduced alternatives to individualism and interactionism by rebuilding developmental constructs and methods
around the dialectical metaphor of participation” (Bidell 1992: 308).
Elsewhere, there are other commentators who conflate Hegelian dialectics
with the dialectical materialism of Marx. The latter describes how the social dimension impacts on the consciousness of the individual. This can look very similar to Vygotsky’s account of how language creates concepts. B. Lee maintains,
for example, discussing Vygotsky, that “as new levels of the organisation of productive forces and relations develop, new forms of consensus emerge. Particular
economic social structures exist as moments in the dialectical interplay between

116

7 Mediation in Vygotsky: ‘Word meaning’

productive forces and relations” (B. Lee 1985: 71). These accounts, again, suggest
a dialectical interplay between the social and the individual which results in concept formation. And this conclusion leads to the view that the Vygotskian notion
of mediation is social.
However, Vygotsky is keen, in fact, to distance himself from the dialecticism
of Marx. He considers Marx’s philosophy as being unlike that of Hegel who is primarily concerned with cognition and how indeterminate perceptions ascend into
more determinate concepts.32 This is not the focus of Marx’s dialecticism and Vygotsky, equally, is not focussing on the ways in which a society develops. At one
point, in fact, Vygotsky categorically states that “the direct application of the theory of dialectical materialism to the problems of the natural science and in particular to the group of biological sciences or psychology is impossible, just as it is
impossible to apply it directly to history and sociology” (Vygotsky 1997a: 330).
And Vygotsky continues this argument by highlighting that several Hegel’s terms
are more relevant to his own work than those of Marx (Vygotsky 1997a 330):
It suffices to imagine Marx operating with the general principles and categories of dialectics, like quantity-quality, the triad, the universal connection, the knot [of contradictions],
leap etc – without the abstract and historical categories of value, class, commodity, capital, interest, production forces, basis, superstructure etc.

In contrast to Marx, therefore, Vygotsky views his own dialecticism in cognitive
terms. Vygotsky explains that there are “two lines of development” involved in
this: “the elementary processes which are biological in origin” and the “higher
psychological functions, of socio-cultural origin” (Vygotsky 1978: 46). The interaction of these dimensions drives a dialectical interplay which creates new
concepts in his ‘third system’. As will be discussed, these “lines of development” echo the interaction between Peirce’s three categories of existence and
his three elements of the sign. It is still true that there remains a role for the
‘social’ in Vygotsky’s dialecticism (e.g., the role of speech), but the central
point here is that the activity of mediation takes place within the mind of the
child and not between the child and society. How this mediating activity takes
place, and how it avoids an exclusively social account of meaning making, will

32 Interestingly, Marx is also of the same opinion when he compares himself with Hegel. He
contrasts the ‘idealism’ of Hegel with his more materialistic focus. In the preface to the second
German edition of Das Capital (Marx and Engels 1996: 19) Marx writes “my dialectic is not only
different from the Hegelian but is its direct opposite. To Hegel, the life-process of the human
brain, i.e., the process of thinking, which under the name of ‘the Idea’, he even transforms
into an independent subject, is the demiurgos of the real world, and the real world is only the
external, phenomenal form of ‘the Idea’. With me, on the contrary, the ideal is nothing else
than the material world reflected by the human mind and translated into forms of thought”.

7.2 Mediation in Vygotsky

117

be the subject of later discussion. But the key issue, at this stage, is that Vygotskian dialecticism takes place within the mind of the child where mediating entities (e.g., ‘word meanings’) are formed.
Vygotsky’s mental, rather than social, interpretation of dialecticism also becomes clear in his differentiation of formal logic from ‘dialectical logic’. The origins of this distinction have already been encountered in our previous discussion
of ‘secondary dualism’. This model asserts that the mind ‘atomises’ its perceptions and that it abstracts qualities from them. As a result, for Vygotsky, formal
logic works along severely impoverished lines: “The path to generalization is
thus a path which leads away from the riches of concrete reality toward the
world of concepts, the kingdom of empty abstractions, far from living life and
from living knowledge” (Vygotsky 1993: 204–205). In contrast, Vygotsky views
‘dialectical logic’ as follows (Vygotsky 1993: 204–205):
In dialectical logic, it is quite the opposite. A concept seems richer in content than it does
in a presentation. Thus, the path to generalization is not a path formally divided into separate indications. Rather, it is an uncovering of the links of the relationship of a given
matter with another. If the subject becomes truly intelligible, not through immediate experience, but in all the many links and relationships which define its place in the world
and its connection to the rest of reality, then one’s understanding is a deeper, more real,
truer, and more complete reflection than the envisaged one.

And, elsewhere, Vygotsky reaffirms his perspective by stating that, “the internal connection of things is disclosed with the help of thinking in concepts, for
to develop a concept of some object means to disclose a series of connections
and relations of that object with all the rest of reality, to include it in the complex system of phenomena” (Vygotsky 1998: 54). This last sentence is one
which could have been written by Peirce himself – the Peircean sign evolves as
it becomes more connected with the world, and this is precisely how the Vygotskian concept grows. And, as noted in Hegel’s account of the universal, the
concept also becomes richer as it becomes more concrete. There are, of course,
some differences in terminology between Vygotsky and Peirce: Vygotsky still
retains some Hegelian terminology when he speaks of “dialectical logic” whilst
Peirce, in contrast, adopts his own language of signs. But they share the same
cognitive template inherited from Hegel.

7.2 Mediation in Vygotsky
Having evaluated the notion of mediation in Hegel and Peirce, consideration
should now be given to the way in which it forms a cornerstone of Vygotsky’s
thinking. As Wertsch correctly notes (Wertsch 1991), the concept of mediation

118

7 Mediation in Vygotsky: ‘Word meaning’

runs through Vygotsky’s thought. But it is important to identify exactly what,
in Vygotsky’s view, is being mediated and where this mediation takes place.
Before analysing Vygotsky’s own views, it is useful to explore the secondary
literature on this topic. As already highlighted, these approaches often construe
the term in ways contextualised by the late twentieth century. Several convergent
themes come to a head here. Firstly, Vygotsky’s work has been used by many
commentators to support their claim that the learning process is social in nature.
They have been eager to play down Piagetian interpretations of this activity
which are more individualistic in tone. Secondly, Vygotsky’s legacy has been invoked by commentators who, quite correctly, reject the outmoded ‘transmission’
model of learning. This views the learning process as a simple matter of instilling
information in the child’s mind. This clearly represents a flawed approach, and
educationalists have borrowed the (apparently) constructivist aspects of Vygotsky’s work to support their attacks upon it. Thirdly, in the former USSR, interpretations of Vygotsky have also resulted in an emphasis on meaning creation as a
social activity. In the Kharkov school there was a desire, after Vygotsky’s death,
to create distance from him and to render his thought more politically acceptable. This resulted in a social dimension being inserted between stimulus and
response mechanisms (S-R). For example (Kozulin 1996: 103) argues that:
Objects of human experience – and therefore objects in psychological experiments – are
socially and culturally meaningful things and not just abstract stimuli. Activity then takes
the place of the dash in the formulation ‘S-R’, turning it into a formula ‘object-activitysubject’, where both the object and subject are historically and culturally specific.

The Kharkov school thus sought to place social activity in a mediating role between an object and the mind. This resulted a re-interpretation of mediation.
Meaning was redefined as being formed socially before being transferred to the
internal sphere of the mind. Kozulin argues, consequently, that “as a general
conclusion, the Kharkovites came to believe that the structure of cognitive processes more or less repeats the structure of external operations” (Kozulin 1996:
111). This, of course, still seemed faithful, in many ways, to the Vygotskian view
that the ‘social’ plays a role in meaning creation, but the essence of Vygotsky’s
notion of mediation had now been abandoned.
There have, therefore, been considerable forces emphasising the social aspects of Vygotskian concept formation. And, indeed, such interpretations do
seem to be supported by Vygotsky’s own words. He states, for example, that
“human learning presupposes a specific social nature and a process by which
children grow into the intellectual life of those around them” (Vygotsky 1978:
88). Elsewhere, he argues, with Luria, that “the most important and basic of
genetic laws, to which the study of higher psychological functions leads us,

7.2 Mediation in Vygotsky

119

reads that every symbolic activity of the child was once a social form of cooperation and preserves throughout its development, to its highest point, the
social method of its functioning” (Vygotsky and Luria 1994: 138). But great care
should be exercised in identifying the exact role of the social dimension in Vygotsky’s thought and how it relates to his notion of mediation.
In due course, a more Hegelian account of Vygotskian mediation will be proposed which locates it within the mind of the individual. It will be argued that
this construal better reflects Vygotsky’s own position and draws him closer to
Peirce. But before this, it is also useful to explore the different interpretations of
Vygotskian ‘mediation’ in the secondary literature. These often seek to be differentiated from each other, but they all tend to be resolutely social in nature:
– Mediation as language, or communication
– Mediation as semiotics, or sign action
– Mediation as activity – including construction and negotiation
– Mediation as participation, or as a shared medium of ‘culture’
One of the more common interpretations of Vygotsky is that, by mediation, he
means the action of words, or speech, on others. And there appear to be plenty
of examples where Vygotsky confirms this view. After all, Vygotsky places the
‘word’ at the centre of his account of concept formation, and many commentators assert, quite rightly, that language is critical to him. Daniels, for example
states that “he understood the development of higher functions in terms of mediated social, collaborative activity. Language is the most crucial of these ‘mediational means’” (Daniels 2016: 48). Meanwhile, Popkewitz (1998: 538) argues
that “Vygotsky focused on language as the instrument which would transfer social experiences to the individual”. And Ma concurs that “language is particularly emphasised by Vygotsky, as it is vital in mediating between individuals
and between the interpsychological and intrapsychological processes of the individual” (Ma 2014: 379).
This Vygotskian emphasis on language also extends to the claim that signs
enable the child to gain a deeper understanding of the world. Again, there is
much evidence for this claim in Vygotsky. He insists that signs, and symbols,
form part of the development of the “higher psychological processes”. C. Lee
argues, for example, that “through an on-going process of semiotic mediation
occurring in specific cultural, social and historical contexts, the young learn
the skills, values and knowledge of the community of which they are a part” (C.
Lee 2005: 254). This interpretation suggests that Vygotskian mediation should
be viewed as a semiotic medium where signs enable a child to develop its concepts. When discussing mediation, Daniels affirms this view, stating that “activity theory posits psychological development and thus psychological analysis as

120

7 Mediation in Vygotsky: ‘Word meaning’

grounded in practical cultural activities. The symbolic approach understands
psychology in terms of collective symbols and concepts” (Daniels 2016: 76). As
words are symbols, it is easy to see how this view of concept formation can become established.
The notion of social ‘activity’ is also important in other interpretations of Vygotsky. This notion has been used by commentators (and not just Soviet ones) to
frame his concept of mediation. In these construals, the social activity of individuals creates meaning through their interaction. As Stetsenko observes (Stetsenko
2017: 148), this leads to a variety of interpretations: “It is no accident that many of
the different units of analysis that have been chosen by scholars working in the
Vygotskian tradition relate to acting and activity – mediated action (Wertsch), activity or event (Rogoff) activity system (Cole and Engestrom) and activity setting
(Tharp and Gallimore)”. Daniels also classifies these differing approaches and
summarises them under various titles such as “situated learning” (Daniels 2016:
70), “distributed cognition” (Daniels 2016: 70), “activity theory” (Daniels 2016: 83)
and “cultural historical activity theory (CHAT)” (Daniels 2016: 78). What is common to all these concepts is the contention, often attributed to Vygotsky himself,
that meaning is created in the social dimension.
This approach to Vygotskian mediation, of course, creates its own theoretical problems. Advocates of these interpretations must explain how meaning is
transferred from the social realm to the child. This is often called the problem
of ‘interiorization’. Bruner, himself an advocate of a ‘cultural’ approach, still
questions whether Vygotsky provides a credible account of this process (Bruner
2001: 202). He challenges other Vygotskian scholars, saying: “Let me turn to another approach to mind and culture, one whose popularity rests, I sometimes
despair, on obscuring many of the issues we have been discussing. It is the
‘interiorization’ position associated with Vygotsky and his followers”. And he
goes on to say (Bruner 2001: 203):
Indeed, interiorization theory obscures the vexing question of the commensurability of
culture and mind by simply asserting that the latter ‘interiorizes’ the former. Vygotsky
and Vygotskians have provided rich accounts of how the child’s mind grows and how it
uses ‘external’ forms, but they have had little to say about how this is accomplished.

As will be discussed in due course, Vygotsky does not, in fact, need to support
such a theory of ‘interiorisation’. Fundamentally, this is because Vygotskian
meaning is not created in a social space, as is often suggested, but is created
within the mind. Bruner, therefore, challenges Vygotsky on a theoretical position which he does not, in fact, hold. But many commentators have adopted
the ‘interiorisation’ model to explain how Vygotskian meaning is created.

7.2 Mediation in Vygotsky

121

Elsewhere, Cole takes Vygotsky’s concept of mediation and translates it into
the slightly different claim that meanings exist in the ‘medium’ of culture. He
proposes, in an article entitled ‘Putting Culture in the Middle’ (Cole 1996: 220):
Culture as a system of artefacts and mind as the process of mediating behaviour through
artefacts in relation to a supra-individual ‘envelope’ with respect to which object/environment, text/context are defined. This approach allows me to make use of the notion of culture as medium and of context as both that which surrounds and that weaves together.

As a proponent of the ‘cultural-historical’ approach, Cole also claims (Cole 1996:
108) that meaning exists in culture in the form of “artefact-mediated” objects. He
suggests that “the initial premise of the cultural-historical school is that human
psychological processes emerged simultaneously with a new form of behaviour
in which humans modified material objects as a means of regulating their interactions with the world and one another”. But Miller (2011: 206) attacks Cole on
this point:
It appears that in Cole’s account of the Russian cultural-historical school, Vygotsky’s most
distinctive and definitive ideas, such as the crucial role of signs as psychological tools and
their functional difference from material tools, are simply ignored. Although he adopts the
term mediation from Vygotsky, Cole does not explicitly point out that his concept of artefact-mediated action differs fundamentally from that of Vygotsky’s sign mediation; that artefact-mediated actions refer to actions carried out by people in the world using artefacts to
better achieve their purposes whereas sign mediation refers to operations that are carried
out internally on psychological functions such as attention and memory.

Miller also criticises another interpretation of Vygotskian mediation; that proposed by Wertsch. The latter espouses a “sociocultural approach” (Wertsch
1991) and suggests that Vygotsky advocates a form of “semiotic mediation”. In
doing so, Wertsch proposes that Vygotsky advocates a form of “decontextualised rationality”. Ironically, Wertsch reaches this conclusion because he sees
signs (assumed to be Saussurean?) as being detached from reality. He argues
that “by taking maximal advantage of the semiotic potential of decontextualization, it is possible to operate strictly within an abstract system, with all the attributes of mastery, conscious awareness, intellectualisation, and volition that
Vygotsky associated with scientific concepts” (Wertsch 1996: 30).
Such an interpretation of “semiotic mediation” is, of course, contrary to Peirce’s semiotics and his notion of secondness. But Wertsch still wants to locate mediation in the realm of culturally created signs and not in the mind of the child.
Miller, again, criticises this approach and insists that Vygotskian mediation
should focus, instead, on the notion of “word meaning” (Miller 2011: 233):
As we have seen, associating Vygotsky with the term ‘mediated action’ is like associating
Freud with consciousness. It is a convenient half-truth that serves to obscure the fact that

122

7 Mediation in Vygotsky: ‘Word meaning’

Vygotsky’s central concern is word meaning and the mediation of mental functions . . .
. . . Wertsch discusses Vygotsky’s emphasis on verbal mediation without even mentioning his emphatic point that sign mediation results in internal changes in the person using
signs as opposed to external changes in the world brought about by mediated actions involving the use of tools.

In other accounts, Lave and Wenger also suggest that meanings are mediated
because they are ‘negotiated’ (Lave and Wenger 2005: 151):
A theory of social practice emphasises the relational interdependency of agent and world,
activity, meaning cognition, learning, and knowing. It emphasises the inherently socially
negotiated character of meaning and the interested, concerned character of thought and
actions of persons-in-activity. This view also claims that learning, thinking, and knowing
are relations among people in activity in, with, and arising from the socially and culturally structured world.

Finally, the cultural aspects of mediation also come to the fore in another position proposed by Cole. Referencing Bruner, he asserts that mediation is, in fact, a
matter of “cultural psychology”. He suggests “Jerome Bruner’s vision of cultural
psychology also emphasises the premise that human experience and action are
shaped by our intentional states. It locates the emergence and functioning of psychological processes within the social-symbolically mediated everyday encounters of people in the lived events of their everyday lives” (Cole 1996: 103).
To summarise, therefore, commentators often conclude that Vygotsky proposes a social model of concept formation when he uses the term ‘mediation’.
Meaning, it is argued, is created by individuals in a social context (using a
range of ‘activity’ verbs such as ‘participating’, ‘negotiating’, ‘constructing’ etc)
and the outcome of this activity is then transferred to the mind of the child in
an act of ‘interiorisation’. An important aspect of these interpretations of Vygotsky is, of course, that they also appear to address one of Vygotsky’s other main
concerns; the problem of dualism. By making the individual part of a social
whole, such philosophical problems seem to be resolved because the individual
is now part of an all-encompassing social structure. The mediating nature of
language, signs, or social activity thus appear to form a bridge across the Cartesian divide. The question, however, is whether this is what Vygotsky means by
the term ‘mediation’? Certainly, he gives a central role to ‘speech’ and ‘words’
in the activity of concept formation. But would he agree with claims that meaning is created primarily within the social realm?
Vygotsky’s own account of mediation proposes that a sign has a profound
effect on the internal structures of the child’s mind. Vygotsky describes this action as follows (Vygotsky 1994: 61–62):

7.2 Mediation in Vygotsky

123

A sign or an auxiliary means of a cultural method thus forms a structural and functional
centre, which determines the whole composition of the operation and the relative importance of each separate process. The inclusion in any process of a sign remodels the whole
structure of psychological operations, just as the inclusion of a tool remodels the whole
structure of a labour operation.

Two observations should be made here. Firstly, Vygotsky claims that mediated
entities “form a structural and functional centre” for the child’s thinking and
they remodel the “whole structure of psychological operations”. As Linask
highlights, “the sign is not just a transference of reaction from one connection
to another, but when used, it actively changes the structure of the entire process as a whole” (Linask 2019: 272). Secondly, Vygotsky notes that signs have
similarities to human “tools”; they form new ways to think about the world.
They are new mental structures created by the mind making its thinking more
efficient. This view clearly echoes the notion of ‘thirds’ in Peirce. Of course, Vygotsky’s usage of the term ‘tools’ can be misleading because it can suggest external objects, or external signs, acting as forms of mediation. Words and
symbols (or knots in string/notches on wood) can act as signs and, indeed,
these types of mediation are mentioned by Vygotsky himself (Vygotsky and
Luria 1994: 143). But it is also clear that Vygotskian signs are much more than
this; they are mediating entities internal to the mind; they remodel the “whole
structure of psychological operations”.
The location of Vygotskian mediation is fundamental to understanding his
psychology. He argues that mediation takes place within the mind of the child
and that concepts evolve there. He sometimes calls these ‘signs’, but this does
not suggest that he always means visual, or verbal, signs experienced by the
child. For Vygotsky, signs also operate internally (Vygotsky 1994: 207):
Investigations, which we are not going to discuss here, have shown that all higher psychological functions are united by one common characteristic, namely that they are mediated processes, i.e., that they incorporate in their structure, as the central and basic part
of the process in general, the use of the sign as a basic means for directing and mastering
the psychological processes.

Importantly, in ‘Thought and Language’ (Vygotsky 2012: 5), Vygotsky calls these
internal mediating entities ‘word meanings’ (‘znachenie’). Valsiner and Van der
Veer note that it is not until the later years of his career that Vygotsky began to
employ this term more frequently (Valsiner and Van der Veer 2000: 375), but,
when he does so, this concept emphasises the internal nature of mediation. It
is, of course, possible to misunderstand ‘word meaning’ as simply suggesting
the ‘meaning of a word’. But, in fact, Vygotsky is using the term in a way which
echoes the mediating roles of Hegel’s Essences and Peirce’s ‘objects of thought’.

124

7 Mediation in Vygotsky: ‘Word meaning’

As such, ‘word meanings’ provide more evidence of the Hegelian influence on
Vygotsky.
In contrast to the more ‘social’ accounts of Vygotsky explored above, it is noticeable how little emphasis is placed on the notion of ‘word meaning’ in the secondary literature. To take just two examples, Moll does not mention the term at all
in ‘L.S. Vygotsky and Education’ (Moll: 2014), and Daniels, in ‘Vygotsky and Pedagogy’ makes just one mention of the term (Daniels 2016: 31). Vygotsky, however,
makes it clear that ‘word meaning’ is the most appropriate unit of analysis for the
dialectical psychologist to study. He argues that it is precisely in terms of these
‘units’ that conceptual development should be understood (Vygotsky 2012: 5):
Psychology, which aims at a study of complex holistic systems, must replace the method
of analysis into elements with the method of analysis into units. What is the unit of verbal
thought that is further unanalyzable and yet retains the properties of the whole? We believe that such a unit can be found in the internal aspect of the word, in word meaning.

‘Word meanings’, as mediating units, are formed dialectically and because they
synthetically combine the experiential and the intellectual, they should not be
broken down into their composite elements. In an analogy, Vygotsky points out
that water behaves in quite different ways to oxygen and hydrogen in isolation;
an understanding of water cannot be achieved by focusing on its components.
Likewise, psychologists cannot grasp how a child thinks if they fail to recognise
that a child’s understanding occurs at the level of synthetic ‘word meanings’.
Interestingly, Peirce also adopts a chemical analogy to explain how they
work. He uses the compounds of carbon (EP2: 363) to make the same point. And
it is with a certain inevitability that both thinkers are, in fact, echoing Hegel in
this respect. In ‘The Science of Logic’ Hegel describes the difference between
flesh and the elements of “nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen” that constitute it. Hegel,
moreover, overtly criticises the flawed “reasoning of an empirical psychologist
when he analyses an action into the various aspects which it presents, and then
sticks to these aspects in their separation” (Hegel 2014: 237). These analogies
again indicate that Hegel, Peirce, and Vygotsky, reject the atomisation of sensory
experience.33 They believe that the human mind works at a higher level where
synthetic meanings are formed, and this is why Vygotsky claims that psychologists should analyse human understanding in terms of ‘word meanings’. He

33 In fact, Aristotle made this philosophical point long before Hegel, Peirce, or Vygotsky. In
his ‘The Metaphysics’ (Aristotle 1998: 229), he discusses the nature of the syllable and says, “so
the syllable is something in its own right, not just a heap of vowel and consonant but something different. Similarly, flesh is not just fire and earth, or hot and cold, but a different
thing”.

7.2 Mediation in Vygotsky

states, for example, that “meaning is the path from the thought to the word.
Meaning is not the sum of all the psychological operations which stand behind the word. Meaning is something more specific – it is the internal structure of the sign operation. It is what is lying between the thought and the
word. Meaning is not equal to the word, not equal to the thought” (Vygotsky
1997a: 133).
It is evident, therefore, that ‘word meanings’ are more than simple external
‘tools’ which provide ‘short cuts’ for human understanding. Rather, they are internal structures created between thought (inner experience) and word/speech
(outer experience), and, as such, they form new conceptual units. Vygotsky
even describes these synthetic unities as an “alloy” (Vygotsky 1978: 30) or as
an “amalgam” (Vygotsky 2012: 225) to highlight this aspect. And, as Linask explains, “word meanings bear the mediating role in individual thinking of a person, as they transfer and organise elementary concrete experience. Thus, words
are means for forming concepts, in which the sensory material is incorporated
into conceptual structures” (Linask 2019: 291).
The exact empirical status of Vygotsky’s ‘word meanings’ needs, of course,
to be treated with great care. Even if it is accepted that they are internal mental
entities, it is still possible to construe them as a correspondence between the
mind and the outside world. Such a construal, however, would have the effect
of re-introducing the binary structures of ‘secondary dualism’. In this context,
it is true that Vygotsky sometimes describes the ‘amalgam’ between thought
and speech as a ‘bond’ and this does suggest that two separate elements are
being held together. But Vygotsky is also keen to emphasise two other aspects
of these. Firstly, the bonds evolve over time. Vygotsky (2012: 223–224) holds
that “thought and word are not connected by a primary bond. A connection
originates, changes, and grows in the course of the evolution of thinking and
speech”. It follows from this that ‘word meanings’ are dynamic – a view that
undermines any idea of simple correspondence. Secondly, and in line with this,
Vygotsky also avoids any suggestion that ‘word meanings’ are established
through what he terms an ‘associative’ bond. It has already been noted that Vygotsky rejects ‘associationism’ and that he prefers a dialectical account of concept formation. It follows from this that the meaning of a concept is not formed
through a direct correspondence with the external world.
This rejection of associationism also has implications for the way in which
‘word meanings’ evolve. In the theoretical template of associationism, the criterion used for establishing the meaning of a word is always the consistency of a
particular word’s usage. This factor often leads to the view that meanings are immutable – if only because Humean ‘constant conjunction’ is used to establish
how meanings are established. In contrast, Vygotsky avoids this conclusion; he

126

7 Mediation in Vygotsky: ‘Word meaning’

argues that meanings evolve dialectically within the mind of the child as new experiences are encountered.
The way in which ‘word meanings’ evolve in the mind is also of significance in relation to Bruner’s criticism that Vygotsky adopts a theory of ‘interiorisation’. Indeed, Vygotsky emphasises, in the following passage, that ‘word
meanings’ are not conveyed to a child in this way. Instead, with Luria, he insists that ‘word meanings’ derive from internal “qualitative transformations”
that take place within the mind of the child (Vygotsky and Luria: 1994: 147):
This means that they are not simply invented or passed down by adults, but rather arise
from something that is originally not a sign operation and that becomes one only after a
series of qualitative transformations, each of which conditions the next stage and is itself
conditioned by the preceding one and thus links them like stages of an integral process,
historical in nature. In this respect the higher psychological functions are no exception to
the general rule and do not differ from other elementary processes. They, too, are subject to
the fundamental law of development which knows no exceptions. They appear in the child’s
general process of psychological development not as something introduced from without
or from within, but as the natural result of this same process.

Linked to this activity is the rotle of speech itself. In line with Vygotsky’s rejection of dualism, he criticises his contemporary psychologists who reduce speech
to a mere external expression of internal thoughts. If speech is construed in this
way, Vygotsky argues that the true role of language in child development cannot
be understood. He points out that “some authors consider speech and reasoning
as entirely different processes, one of which serves as the expression and the
outer clothing of the other” (Vygotsky 1994: 68). Significantly, Vygotsky includes
Piaget in this criticism. In this context, Vygotsky describes the thoughts which
emerge at the biological level as ‘spontaneous’ concepts, whilst defining those
that speech helps engender as ‘non-spontaneous’ concepts. In this distinction
Vygotsky agrees with Piaget, but he goes on to argue that Piaget makes the mistake of concluding that these two sets of concepts remain dualistically apart. Vygotsky states that “Piaget is only able to differentiate between the spontaneous
and the non-spontaneous concepts, but he is unable to see the facts which unite
them into a single system of concepts formed during the course of a child’s mental development. He only sees the gap, not the connection” (Vygotsky 1994: 361).
In addition, Vygotsky criticises the widespread assumption that human
thought comes first, and that speech is a secondary manifestation of it. Vygotsky reverses this process and maintains that speech also has a critical role in
informing thought. At one level, this seems to be non-controversial – of course,
the content of received speech influences an individual. But Vygotsky is making the far stronger claim that human concepts themselves are formed using the
words of others. He states this when he asserts that “just as a mold gives shape

7.2 Mediation in Vygotsky

127

to a substance, words can shape an activity into a structure” (Vygotsky 1978:
28). To support this view, Vygotsky claims that he has identified the role of received speech in his experiments using “double stimulation” (Vygotsky and
Luria 1994: 159). He argues that the introduction of a second level of stimulation (through an adult’s words) helps a child form new concepts in problemsolving. This view can suggest that, after all, Vygotsky accepts that ‘word
meanings’ come from external social sources. But a child’s concepts, whilst
being informed by these external inputs, are still the outcome of their internal
dialectical processes.
This analysis of ‘word meanings’ also has implications for the precise role
of symbols in Vygotsky’s thought. For Peirce, words (as symbols) only emerge
in the final stages of sign formation. In contrast to this, Vygotsky proposes that
the words of others play a role at a much earlier stage. The symbols of others,
therefore, help a child form ‘word meanings’ by providing inputs for them (Vygotsky 1994: 130–131):
The system of symbols reconstructs the whole psychological process, and the speaking
child masters its movement on a totally new foundation . . . . Movement detaches itself
from direct perception and submits to symbolic functions included in the reactive act,
thus breaking with the natural history of behaviour and turning a new page: that of the
higher intellectual activity of man.

But it is important to emphasise here that Vygotsky is not suggesting that the
symbols of others are the source of a child’s concepts. Instead, he argues that
their role is partial. He maintains that a child’s conceptual development benefits from the input of others, but only if the child already possesses pre-existing
‘natural’, or ‘spontaneous’, concepts. The words of others certainly aid concept
development, but external input alone will not result in new concepts. As Vygotsky clearly states, the activity of teaching mere words to children, without
pre-existing concepts, is what he calls a “fruitless” cause (Vygotsky 2012: 159):
Practical experience also shows that direct teaching of concepts is impossible and fruitless. A teacher who tries to do this usually accomplishes nothing but empty verbalism, a
parrot-like repetition of words by the child, simulating knowledge of the corresponding
concepts but actually covering up a vacuum.

Overall, therefore, Vygotssky’s ‘word meanings’ exhibit many of the same characteristics which have been encountered in Hegel and Peirce. They are formed
within the mind as mediating entities and they are synthetic in nature. They combine two elements in a conceptual ‘amalgam’ which allows the child to create
new concepts and, as a result, new ways of understanding the world. In the
hands of Hegel and Peirce such mediating entities are established as hypothetical

128

7 Mediation in Vygotsky: ‘Word meaning’

identities (e.g., Essences, or ‘objects of thought’) and they are fashioned by either
Hegelian dialecticism, or by Peircean secondness.
In the case of Vygotsky, however, the conceptual ‘alloy’ formed by ‘word
meanings’ has slightly different sources. It comprises the ‘natural’, or ‘spontaneous’ perceptions of the child and the external ‘words’ of others. These come
together to create a child’s higher concepts in a conceptual ‘amalgam’. In chapter twelve, Vygotsky’s analysis of concept formation will be explored in more
detail, and it will become evident how Hegel informs his dialectical process.
But discussion must now return to Peirce to elucidate how his three elements of
the sign combine with his three categories to form his own semiotic account of
concept formation.

Part Three: Concept formation in Peirce
and Vygotsky

8 Peirce: The classification of signs and the first
trichotomy
In the first two sections of this essay, consideration has been given to how the
Hegelian template of concept formation contrasts with that of ‘secondary dualism’. It has been noted that these two distinct approaches are founded in their
respective construals of perception. It has also been emphasised that the models of Hegel and Peirce involve an evolution from ‘vague’ to more determinate
perceptions. And, in this context, Peirce’s understanding of the three elements
in the sign and his three categories has been explored. What has not been considered, however, is how Peirce explains the interaction of his three categories
with the three elements of the sign. This is important, because it is through this
process of mediation that Peirce explains the details of concept formation. As
noted earlier, Peirce maintains that this activity represents an alternative to the
dialecticism of Hegel. It is important, therefore, to understand how Peirce views
this process beginning with perceptual vagues and culminating in the formation of symbols, propositions, and arguments.
The focus of this chapter is primarily on Peirce’s classification of signs.
This framework is critical because it elucidates how Peirce explains the combination of sign types. These interactions should be construed, therefore, as the
staging posts in the ‘speculative’ process highlighted in Figure 1. Deacon agrees
on this key point, suggesting that “these taxonomic hierarchies describe the
cognitive stages of sign interpretation” (Deacon 2014: 95). He is acutely aware,
however, that this claim is “an almost heretical departure from contemporary
Peircean scholarship” (Deacon 2014: 95). The latter, he observes, tends to construe Peirce’s signs “synchronically and independently” (Deacon 2014: 95)
rather than as part of a gradual process of sign combination.34 But Deacon is
correct; if it is assumed that Peirce’s classification amounts to a taxonomy of

34 Deacon comes close to advocating the position outlined in this essay. He maintains that Peirce’s sign classification should be construed as a cumulative process of signs combining and
building upon each other. Deacon also confirms, in line with this essay, that Peirce’s sign classification should be read in two ways – as an activity of semiosis as signs combine (“sign development”) or, conversely, as “sign analysis” (Deacon 2014: 98). However, Deacon does not
recognise several of Peirce’s key insights. He still uses the language of the ‘sign vehicle’ and this
relates to the fact that he does not mention the indeterminate nature of the representamen. However, he certainly recognises that its nature changes through the action of the interpretant: “although the presence of a representamen precedes the generation of its interpretant in time, the
semiotic function of this representamen is assigned by this process of interpretant generation. In

independent sign types, or simply facilitates an identification of the components of more complex signs, then understanding of its true purpose will be
lost – to outline the formation and growth of human concepts.
In this chapter, therefore, an overview will be conducted of Peirce’s sign classification. Then the first trichotomy in this classification will be analysed. The
philosophical task of understanding the second trichotomy, consisting of icons,
indices, and symbols, will be addressed in chapters nine and ten. This second trichotomy demands more attention because it is where empirical concept formation
takes place, and it is also where misinterpretations of Peirce have been the most
profound. These two reasons are, of course, inter-related. If Peirce is read with the
assumption that the identity of a ‘sign vehicle’ is already known, then it is difficult
to make sense of his classification of signs. It’s very purpose – to uncover how
human conceptual meaning is formed – will be redundant because meaning is
already assumed to exist in the supposed identity of the sign vehicle.

8.1 Peirce’s classification of signs
Peirce’s sign classification is notorious for its complexity and, in the words of
Short (1982: 285), can become a “journey into darkest semiotica”. Hookway,
likewise, describes Peirce’s classification as “bewildering” (1985: 125). Other
commentators have tended to simply circumvent discussion of it. Deely, for example, whilst asserting that his own semiotic approach is close to that of
Peirce, tends to marginalise the role of his sign classification.
To begin our analysis of Peirce’s classification, however, it is essential to
recognise that his sign structure is triadic in two senses. It involves three categories combining with three elements of the sign. This leads to nine sign types.
On the one hand, there are three experiential categories based on potentiality,
actuality, and necessity – firstness, secondness and thirdness. On the other,
there are three elements of the sign – the representamen, the object and the
interpretant. It is critical to understand how these two sets of triads interrelate
with each other.35 As Stjernfelt correctly highlights the resulting nine sign types

this respect, the semiotic function of a given representamen only comes into existence after the
process of interpretant generation is completed” (Deacon 2014: 99–100).
35 Dewey, in a paper called “Kant and the Philosophic Method” (1884), included in Goetzmann’s “American Hegelians” (Goetzmann 1973: 150), describes the operation of Hegel’s categories in a way that closely echoes Peirce. He states:

8.1 Peirce’s classification of signs

are “nested so that the more complicated signs contain, embed or involve specimens of the simpler signs” (Stjernfelt: 2014: 4). The following outline of Peirce’s
classification is found in several secondary sources (e.g., Nöth 1995: 45; Olteanu 2015: 73):

It is noteworthy that Peirce’s classification positions the ‘object’ in the middle
column – confirming its mediating role in the structure of sign. But, as it stands,
this version of the classification does not include, along the horizontal axis, any
verb to specify the exact relationship between the three elements of the sign and
the three categories. This is because the way these elements interrelate is the
focus of this chapter. It must be acknowledged, however, that some commentators do not even agree with this basic layout of the classification (Sheriff 1994:
41; Deacon 2014: 98; Olteanu 2015: 73; Feibleman 1969: 93). Feibleman, for example, places three different terms along the horizontal axis – Sign, Ground and Object – thereby limiting the scope of the term ‘sign’ to one column and confusing
matters by placing ‘object’ in the column that should be occupied by the term ‘interpretant’. Elsewhere, Deacon describes the first column as consisting of types of

Hence the method must examine the categories without any reference to subjective or objective existences; or, to speak properly, since we now see that there are no purely subjective or objective existences, without any relation to things and thoughts as two distinct
spheres. The antithesis between them is not to be blinked out of sight, but it must be
treated as one which exists within Reason and not one with one term in and the other
out. The categories which, for the individual, determine the nature of the object, and
those which state how the object is brought into the subjective form of cognition, must be
deduced from Reason alone.”
This description, by Dewey, parallels Peirce’s account of how the three categories interact with
each other to “determine the nature of the object”, and how they bring it “into the subjective
form of cognition” as a mediating object.

134

‘sign vehicle’ (Deacon 2014: 98). And both Sheriff and Olteanu place the categories of firstness, secondness and thirdness along the horizontal axis as well as in
the vertical one. This creates problems of its own. Firstly, it is now difficult to
show how each element of the sign interacts with the categories (although Olteanu does discuss this). Secondly, it makes it much harder to follow the transition from ‘vagues’, in the first trichotomy, to specific statements about the world
in the third trichotomy.
In trying to understand the various interpretations of Peirce’s classification,
it is important to focus on the fact that Peirce wants to demonstrate how the
two axes interact with each other. As such, and referencing our previous analysis, it is now possible to introduce some detail into Peirce’s classification:

At this stage, this revision seems abstract, but it begins to reflect what Peirce
means when he talks, for example, about a “first of a first” (e.g., CP1: 543).
However, utilising learnings from our earlier analysis, it is possible to redefine
the ‘object’ in the classification as an ‘object of thought’. The effect of this is
outlined below:

It must be admitted, however, that this revised formulation remains rather difficult to comprehend. But it is possible to demonstrate how it works in practice
by using an example of how a single concept develops in this combination of
sign types. This shows how the systematic growth of a concept takes place in
Peirce’s model. Using the example of ‘rain’, it can be demonstrated how such a
concept develops from an initial ‘vague’ sensation to an element in a system of
knowledge.

Figure 10: Developing the Concept of ‘Rain’ in Peirce’s Sign Classification.

This revision of Peirce’s classification outlines, in multiple stages, the evolution
of a particular concept (e.g., a ‘natural history of the sign’ (Vygotsky 1978: 45)),
from an experiential ‘vague’ through to its emergence within a system of other
concepts. Fundamentally, this account of Peirce’s sign classification describes a
dynamic process between the three elements of the sign and his three categories.
Some commentators36 overlook this dynamism, but, as Muller correctly insists,

36 For example, in ‘Purely Objective Reality’, Deely (2009) gives relatively little attention to
Peirce’s evolution of signs from qualisigns to arguments. These building blocks are present, as
discussed, in Peirce’s philosophy because he is following a Hegelian template. They are, however, notably absent in Deely. In fact, his account follows, in many respects, the more ‘interpretive’ model espoused by biosemiotics. Deely argues, for example, that (Deely 2009: 65):
The things of the environment, then, begin as objects in the interaction between the animal organism and its material surroundings inasmuch (and only inasmuch) as this interaction sparks awareness, sparks a cognition. In this initial cognition the environment is
aspectually and in limited ways objectified or made to enter into the awareness of the
organism, made known; whence this initial awareness is interpreted by the organism on
the basis of its biology and experience (in which the past and the hopes too of the organism

136

8 Peirce: The classification of signs and the first trichotomy

we should not think of Peirce’s framework as a “statics of classification” but,
rather, as a “dynamics of semiosis” (Muller 1994: 145).
In day-to-day human experience ‘signs’ are encountered at different stages
in Peirce’s semiosis. This involves an ascent from qualisigns, to signs with developing ‘objects of thought’, through to fully created symbols. Some ‘objects of
thought’, indeed, may never reach the stage where they become symbols and
may never be utilised, as a result, in propositions or in arguments. As a result,
‘objects of thought’, in the second trichotomy, can be found at different stages of
evolution and, indeed, different individuals may think of the same ‘object of
thought’ in different ways. For example, the Eiffel Tower can be understood as a
physical object, or as a structure with particular indexical attributes (e.g., it is in
Paris), or as a symbol of France. These semiotic variations reflect how an ‘object
of thought’ may be construed at different stages of its development.
This analysis also helps explain some of Peirce’s more technical terminology when he discusses his sign types. Some signs are not yet developed, but
they can still be considered as the potential building blocks of future signs. At
this earlier stage, Peirce describes them as “degenerate” signs (EP2: 306), whilst
he maintains that “genuine” signs are symbols (EP2: 307) because they are
‘thirds’. But this technical distinction does not detract from Peirce’s contention
that all nine sign types play a part in the activity of sign development.37

for sure come to bear) and presented within the animal’s objective world as to be sought,
avoided, or safely ignored. [my italics]
37 The discussion, in this section, is focused on how signs are formed in the ‘speculative’
stage of their development. But as noted in Figure 1, there is also a second dimension where
signs are used, to form propositions and arguments. In this latter stage (‘speculative rhetoric’),
Peirce explains how they articulate ‘possibility’, ‘existence’, and ‘law’ (CP2: 236–237). These
possibilities are outlined in his table below. I have emphasised the ways these signs are articulated in this second dimension by emboldening the words ‘terms’, ‘propositions’, and ‘arguments’ in the third column. This is critical because, in this table, Peirce is working from the
perspective of the third trichotomy. But this dimension is quite distinct from that of ‘speculative
grammar’ where signs are formed.

At some risk of over-simplification, it is possible to outline the overall dynamic within Peirce’s sign classification. It acts ‘downwards’ in the first column
and then moves on, in a similar manner, in the second and third columns. This
movement concludes, in the bottom right-hand corner, with ‘arguments’. As
suggested earlier, this ascent should be viewed as a Peircean reflection of Hegel’s conceptual evolution from Being to Essence to Notion. Broadly speaking,
qualisigns are the equivalent of Being, symbols equate to Notions, and, when
the latter combine, in inter-relating arguments, they echo the Hegelian Absolute. In this construal, the activity that takes place in Peirce’s second trichotomy is equivalent to Hegel’s dialecticism. This is where an Essence is first
posited and then progressively determined. In the formation of an icon, the addition of indices, and their sublation into symbols, signs are thought to build
upon one other. As Andacht (2013: 519) rightly comments, this dynamic process
is at the heart of Peirce’s classification:

8 Peirce: The classification of signs and the first trichotomy

If we do not act with theoretical caution, the Peircean sign classification may be misunderstood, and that would lead us to a static, non-triadic, reductionistic conception of the
real functioning of signs in the world, as if each kind of sign worked in isolation from
each other, or even worse, according to a nominalistic and dualistic mechanism.

8.2 Qualisigns, sinsigns and legisigns
As we will see, a Hegelian revision of Peircean semiotics has its greatest impact
in Peirce’s second trichotomy where a sign builds from icon to index, to symbol, in a way that involves empirical reality. At the level of the first trichotomy,
in contrast, there are relatively few points of divergence between other accounts of Peirce and the one that is proposed here. But there are still important
points that should be highlighted. The most critical of these derive from the
fact that modern semioticians should not assume that they know the identity of
the representamen. If they make this error, they undermine its inherent indeterminacy. This is critical to an understanding of Peirce’s classification because
such construals lead to features of the second trichotomy being unwittingly included within the first trichotomy.
Peirce describes the ‘qualisign’ in his essay entitled ‘Nomenclature and Divisions of Triadic Relations, as Far as They Are Determined’: “a Qualisign is a quality
which is a sign. It cannot actually act as sign until it is embodied; but the embodiment has nothing to do with its character as a sign” (EP2: 291). A qualisign,
therefore, is only the possibility of a quality. It is not a sign in its own right; it can
only be observed as part of a sinsign. A qualisign, as a result, must be embodied
in something else to be experienced – following our analysis of Peircean ‘firsts’.
An example of a qualisign is a perceptual experience of a shade of red. But one
cannot say that it is a shade of ‘red’ at this point – it simply represents the possibility of being such; it has no actual identity. Two issues are key here. Firstly, the
qualisign, because it is a representamen, is still a ‘vague’. It might be shade of
red, but it also might be a shade of ‘crimson’, or ‘magenta’. Secondly, this treatment of the qualisign parallels earlier discussions of Peirce’s percepts and ‘perceptual judgments’. The percept is a ‘vague’ that is subsequently classified by a
‘perceptual judgment’. This is exactly what a qualisign is too. It is no more than
a ‘possibility’ because ‘perceptual judgments’ are always open to revision. The
only difference, in the case of the qualisign, is that a perceptual ‘vague’ is now
enrolled in a sign.
In terms of the sinsign, Peirce defines this sign type as (EP2: 291):
A Sinsign (where the syllable sin is taken as meaning ‘being only once’ as in single, simple,
Latin semel, etc.) is an actual existent thing or event which is a sign. It can only be so

8.2 Qualisigns, sinsigns and legisigns

139

through its qualities; so that it involves a qualisign, or rather, several qualisigns. But
these qualisigns are of a peculiar kind and only form a sign through being actually
embodied.

There is wide agreement as to what Peirce intends by the qualisign, but with
the sinsign a range of different interpretations are encountered. The most useful involves an understanding of what is included, and what is not included, in
this sign type – and this, in turn, depends on a grasp of what the columns and
rows in Peirce’s sign classification entail.
With the sinsign, a dyadic (but momentary) relationship is observed; and,
critically, no ‘object of thought’ (in the second trichotomy) is yet involved in the
sign. In the quotation above, Peirce emphasises that the sinsign involves the embodiment of a qualisign. But it is not possible to be sure what that embodied
quality is. A sinsign, therefore, is a ‘vague’ quality that is embodied – an aspect
of the sinsign that is often underplayed. For example, assuming that the identity
of a ‘sign vehicle’ is known, Jappy mistakenly claims that a ‘sketch’, or a ‘photograph’, are sinsigns (Jappy 2013: 13). But, in doing so, he has already given the
embodied qualisign an identity. This assumption, however, is to run ahead of
ourselves. Likewise, Liszka (1996: 36) discussing sinsigns, talks of a “red buzzer”,
thereby giving the experience of red a specific identity – something which is not
yet possible with a sinsign. It is important to emphasise, however, that whilst a
sinsign is still ‘vague’, it has, at least, been actualised.
The legisign is the last of the three signs in the first trichotomy. Peirce describes it in these terms (EP2: 291):
A Legisign is a law that is a sign. This law is usually established by men. Every conventional sign is a legisign. It is not a single object, but a general type which, it has been
agreed, shall be significant. Every legisign signifies through an instance of its application,
which may be termed a Replica of it. Thus, the word, ‘the’ will usually occur from fifteen
to twenty-five times on a page. It is in all these occurrences one and the same word, the
same legisign. Each single instance of it is a replica. The replica is a sinsign. Thus, every
legisign requires sinsigns. But these are not ordinary sinsigns, such as are peculiar occurrences that are regarded as significant. Nor would the replica be significant if it were not
for the law which renders it so.

Legisigns, therefore, are signs which rely on conventional rules or laws “established by men” to give them significant value. However, and importantly, a legisign does not tell us about the empirical world because, like the sinsign, it is not
in the second trichotomy. The legisign, therefore, is “a general type which, it has
been agreed, shall be significant”. Legisigns, as a result, include conventional
signs, but exclude any reference to the empirical world. They are systems of signs
created by human culture. As such, the legisign exists in a semiotic space that
does permit arbitrary sign systems. Two individuals can, for example, agree that

140

8 Peirce: The classification of signs and the first trichotomy

a bottle cap can ‘stand for’ a missing rook in a game of chess. They can decide
upon this convention without the category of secondness (empirical reality) impinging upon them. As such, Peirce argues that “this law is usually established
by men”. In other words, Peirce places the whole of Saussurean semiology in
this part of his sign classification. Legisigns are signs based on systems of conventional rules and sinsigns are ‘tokens’ of these rules. Saussure’s arbitrary sign
holds sway here, but this is because legisigns are in the part of Peirce’s sign classification which is yet to include ‘objects of thought’.
The fact that the category of secondness has no impact on the meanings of
legisigns is often overlooked by commentators. The full implications of this
oversight only become apparent, however, in the next stage of sign development – the icon. This sign type, initialising the second trichotomy, gives the
emerging sign an empirical footing in the world. The icon achieves this because
it is the first sign type to introduce a putative empirical ‘object of thought’ into
sign formation. As such, the icon forms a lynchpin in Peirce’s semiotics. It permits a transition from the first trichotomy to the development of the intellect’s
empirical conceptual apparatus. The icon, therefore, is fundamental to Peirce’s
account of how Cartesian dualism can be overcome through his semiotics. And
because of this, the icon is the central focus of the following two chapters.

9 The received view of the Peircean icon
As has been suggested, the icon is a key element in Peircean semiotics because
it is at this point that his sign types begin to engage with empirical reality. As
such, the icon is the semiotic mechanism that allows the human mind to cross
the cognitive ‘gap’ imposed by Cartesian dualism. The icon establishes a cognitive vehicle (an ‘object of thought’) which becomes a placeholder for subsequent indexical knowledge of the world. None of this, however, is evident to
semioticians if they retain adherence to ‘secondary dualism’. If they assume
that signs are known ‘sign vehicles’, the icon simply becomes a sign type based
on similarity. But this status would be a pale reflection of the role of the icon in
Peirce’s semiotics.
This discussion of the Peircean icon falls into two parts. In this chapter, an
evaluation is conducted of how the icon has been construed, with varying success, by a range of modern semioticians. In the next chapter, a revised account
is then proposed which contextualises the icon within Hegelian philosophy – a
task seldom attempted in the secondary literature. It will be suggested, in
this second chapter, that the Peircean icon equates to the Hegelian Essence. It
is an identity, or ‘form’, posited by the mind, which initiates concept formation.
The ‘received’ view of the icon is well known. It maintains that it involves a
relationship of ‘similarity’ between two things – the sign (vehicle) (residing on
the ‘mirror’ of the mind) and its referent object (in the world). As such, the iconic
sign is frequently contrasted with the index and the symbol. The relationships
between these three sign types and their respective ‘objects’ (in the world) is how
they are conventionally differentiated. There are many examples of this approach
in the literature. Fiske (1990: 46) argues that “in an icon the sign resembles its
object in some way; it looks or sounds like it. In an index there is a direct link
between a sign and its object; the two are actually connected. In a symbol there
is no connection or resemblance between sign and object: a symbol communicates only because people agree that it shall stand for what it does”. And Delaney
(1993: 136) makes a similar distinction between the three sign types:
Icons are those signs which represent their objects in virtue of a qualitative resemblance
to them (paintings, maps); indices represent their objects in virtue of some dyadic existential relation, such as causality or indication (weathervanes, directional arrows); symbols represent their objects only in terms of some general conventions or rules (nautical
flags, Morse code).

The icon, therefore, has a relationship with an object based on “resemblance”;
the index on an “existential relation”, and the symbol has a relationship with

142

9 The received view of the Peircean icon

its object founded on “conventions” or “rules”. But, as we have seen, Peirce
means an ‘object of thought’ when he uses the term ‘object’ and it follows that
his three sign types should not be distinguished on this basis. ‘Secondary dualism’, of course, plays a role here. If semioticians assume that the ‘object’ is in
the world, it will follow that the icon becomes an image of that object on the
‘mirror’ of the mind. There are many examples of this in the literature; Morris
talks about the similarities between the sign (as a mental entity) and its ‘denotata’ (Morris 1946: 349) and Sebeok likewise discusses the similarity between
the signifier and its ‘denotata’ (Sebeok 1994: 28). Such accounts lead to the
icon being misconstrued as a similarity established across a dualistic divide.

9.1 Distinguishing icons from hypoicons
If these potential confusions are not enough, there is also an additional piece of
Peircean terminology which demands clarification. This is his distinction between
icons and ‘hypoicons’. He makes this distinction, paradoxically, to clarify his own
concept of iconicity. But the effect is often to deepen confusion.
Icons involve the notion of similarity, but Peirce also recognises that some
things are assertions of similarity. Peirce wishes to set these phenomena aside
as being separate to iconicity itself. Peirce distinguishes these kinds of phenomena by calling them ‘hypoicons’ (EP2: 273–274):
But a sign may be iconic, that is, may represent its object mainly by its similarity, no matter
what its mode of being. If a substantive be wanted, an iconic Representamen may be
termed a hypoicon. Any material image, as a painting, is largely conventional in its mode of
representation; but in itself, without legend or label, it may be called a hypoicon. Hypoicons
may roughly [be] divided according to the mode of Firstness which they partake. Those
which partake the simple qualities, or First Firstnesses, are images; those which represent
the relations, mainly dyadic, or so regarded, of the parts of one thing by analogous relations in their own parts, are diagrams; those which represent the representative character
of a representamen by representing a parallelism in something else, are metaphors.

Peirce thus maintains that an icon “may represent its object . . .. no matter
what its mode of being”, whilst hypoicons, in contrast, are images, diagrams or
metaphors. Importantly, he uses the word “material” to describe hypoicons. All
three have one thing in common; they are public representations of similarity.
This has the effect of placing hypoicons in Peirce’s third trichotomy – whilst
iconicity operates in the second trichotomy.
In contrast to hypoicons, the action of iconicity, and icon formation, is a cognitive activity that takes place within the individual mind. This critical distinction
can be overlooked if it is assumed that images, photographs, or diagrams are icons

9.2 Attacks on the Peircean icon

143

because of their similarity to the objects they depict. Andacht, however, fully recognises Peirce’s intended distinction between iconicity, and hypoicons. He maintains that there is a “distinction between the purely qualitative possibility (the icon
proper) and its material embodiment (the hypoicon)” (Andacht 2013: 509).
It must be acknowledged, however, that Peirce, himself is hardly consistent in
the use of his own terminology. For example, having cited a painting as an example of a ‘hypoicon’, he can also be observed referring to a photograph as an ‘icon’
when he states that “a photograph is an icon, usually conveying a flood of information. A piece of mimicry may be an auditory icon” (EP2: 13). These inconsistencies do make his analysis of iconicity difficult to follow. But leaving this aside, it is
important to now review how other commentators have construed the icon.

9.2 Attacks on the Peircean icon
There have been considerable attacks on the Peircean icon in the late twentieth
century. These have represented an attempt to demonstrate that the icon is little more than a conventional sign; in other words, it operates like a symbol. As
Stjernfelt observes, there has arisen, as a result, a “thoroughgoing conventionalism” (2007: 51) in semiotic analyses of this sign type. Petrilli’s definition of the
icon (Petrilli 2010: 242) serves to exemplify such misconceptions:
Icon: One of three types of signs identified by Charles S. Peirce, the other two being index
and symbol. The icon is characterised by a relation of similarity between the sign and its
object. However, similarity alone will not suffice to determine an iconic sign. Twins look
similar but are not signs of each other. My reflection in the mirror looks like me but is not
an iconic sign. For iconic signs to obtain the effect of convention or habit social practices
or special functions must be added to similarity. Iconic similarity is a special kind of similarity: it is an abstraction on the basis of convention, for it privileges given traits of similarity and not others.

Several points can be made here. Firstly, as we have seen before, Petrilli claims
that “a relation of similarity between the sign and its object” forms the icon. Secondly, she suggests that icons are, therefore, misconceived because many things
(which are also like each other) are not icons. She concludes, as a result, that
similarity must be an illegitimate basis on which to establish iconicity. Thirdly,
she comes to the view that the icon must, therefore, be a conventional sign because only this factor privileges some kinds of similarity over others. Chandler
forms the same opinion when he holds that “semioticians generally maintain
that there are no ‘pure’ icons – there is always an element of cultural convention
involved” (Chandler 2002: 40).

144

9 The received view of the Peircean icon

Umberto Eco initiated this critique of the Peircean icon by insisting upon
its conventionality. He considered various ways in which an icon could resemble its object – in terms of it having the “same properties as its object”, being
“similar to its object”, being “analogous’ to its object”, or being “motivated” by
its object (Eco 1976: 191). Eco rejected all these solutions as untenable ways of
establishing ‘similarity’ (Eco 1976: 200):
Thus, even the continuous line tracing the profile of the horse may be considered as the
institution of a relation of similitude by a transformed correspondence point to point between the abstract visual content model of a horse and an image drawn on a given surface. The image is motivated by the abstract representation of the horse, but it is
nevertheless the effect of a cultural decision and as such requires a trained eye in order to
be detected as a horse’s profile. Similitude is produced and must be learned.

Eco concludes his critique with a section entitled “Getting Rid of Iconic Signs”
(Eco 1976: 216–220). Here he argues that icons are formed by social convention;
some of these similarities are easily recognised (‘ratio facilis’) whilst others are
less obviously coded (‘ratio difficilis’). But cultural convention, he insists, remains at the heart of iconicity – a position reiterated by Sebeok (1994: 30):
An infant daughter can be said to be an iconic design for her mother if there is a topological similarity between her, as signifier, and her mother, its denotatum; however, the little
girl can likewise, though doubtless to a lesser degree, stand as an iconic sign for her father, every one of her siblings, all of her kinfolk, and, further still, all mammals, all vertebrates, and so forth, and so on, in unending retrogression to ever more generalized
denotata.

Elsewhere, Sebeok also highlights that the icon does not work reflexively (Sebeok 1976: 130). For example, a photograph of the Pope can be described as an
icon, but it makes no sense to describe the Pope as an icon of his own photograph. Such criticisms of the icon betray, however, their underlying assumption
that iconicity involves a relationship between an image and an object in the
world.
Later in his career, Eco published, in ‘Kant and the Platypus’ (Eco 1999), a
remarkably honest revision of his previous thinking on Peirce’s icon. In this, he
accepts that he previously misunderstood several elements this Peircean sign. He
discusses Kant and the latter’s notion of the ‘schema’. However, Eco makes little
mention of Hegel, and there remain significant differences between his revised
position and the one proposed in the following chapter. Despite this, it is worth
detailing Eco’s revised view – if only to clarify his new perspective on the icon.
In ‘Kant and the Platypus’, Eco makes a correct distinction between the icon
and the hypoicon. He isolates, as a result, what he calls the “problem of perceptual
iconism” (Eco 1999: 106–112) – the role of iconicity in sign formation. Eco argues

9.2 Attacks on the Peircean icon

145

that ‘primary iconism’ parallels Kant’s notion of “schemata” (Eco 1999: 80) because the latter form classifications of perceptions. He also notes, in an important
observation, that such Kantian schemata are the “product of the imagination”
(Eco 1999: 81). However, Eco’s revised position still differs from that of Peirce.
Whilst Peirce maintains that ‘perceptual judgments’ classify percepts; Eco still insists that such classifications are a matter of interpretation. As a result, Eco retains
a clear attachment to constructivism (Eco 1999: 88):
By reflecting upon the data from the sensible intuition, by comparing them, assessing
them, by using an innate and secret art hidden in the deepest profundities of the human
soul (and therefore of our own transcendental apparatus) we do not abstract but construct
the schemata.

In this passage, Eco seizes defeat from the jaws of victory. On the verge of identifying the linkages between perceptual judgments and Peirce’s icon, Eco retains his nominalist leanings.38 He concludes that schemata are constructions
from sense data and, as such, he preserves an interpretative approach to iconicity. And he maintains, in this constructivist mode, that some of these classifications are formed individually, whilst others are shared within a culture. This is
made clear when Eco makes a distinction between “cognitive types” (CT) and
“nuclear content” (NC). The former are perceptual categorisations, and the latter are culturally formed (Eco 1999: 137–141; Stjernfelt: 2007: 69). As a result,
Eco continues to construe the icon within a cultural framework.
Overall, therefore, although Eco addresses several of the errors in his earlier account of the icon, he still interprets this sign type within the template of
‘secondary dualism’. Stjernfelt agrees with this conclusion, suggesting that Eco
remains stranded, as it were, in a “complete quagmire of a crude nature-culture
dualism” (Stjernfelt 2007: 65). In addition to this, Eco also construes the icon as
forming a similarity between two known identities which renders it dyadic in
nature. This position is fundamentally flawed because Eco has not grasped the
significance of the position of the icon in Peirce’s sign classification. He has not
recognised that Peirce uses the idea of ‘resemblance’ in a way which is monadic
rather than dyadic. This point will be discussed in due course. It is central to
understanding the icon.

38 Eco (1999: 65) highlights a quotation where Peirce states, referring to Kant, that “if the
schemata had been considered early enough, they would have overgrown his [Kant’s] whole
work” (W5: 258–259). Peirce’s point here is that Kant’s framework of schema would have resulted in a treatment of perception that would have undermined his intuitionism. Eco, however, does not recognise that Peirce’s notion of the schema opens a revised understanding of
the icon based on it positing a ‘form’.

146

9 The received view of the Peircean icon

9.3 Stjernfelt’s diagrammatology
Stjernfelt is recognised as a revisionist of Peirce’s icon. Many of Stjernfelt’s arguments concerning the icon find important resonances in this essay. Indeed,
his assertion that the human mind can form ‘natural propositions’ echoes the
Hegelian claim that synthetic knowledge of the world is possible. But there remain some fundamental divergences between the account of the icon proposed in
the next chapter and the one adopted by Stjernfelt. In particular, he places great
emphasis on the ability of the diagram to manifest knowledge (in the second dimension of ‘speculative rhetoric’ Figure 1), whilst tending to minimise the role of
the icon itself in the earlier, and formative, stage of sign evolution.
For Stjernfelt, the icon is also based on the similarity between an object and
a sign. As such, he largely follows previous interpretations of the icon (Stjernfelt
2014: 206):
Icons function by means of a similarity between the sign and the object, or, as Peirce may
also say, by shared characteristics between the sign and its object. Indices function by
means of an actual connection between the sign and the object, either of a causal character (the footprint on the beach) or of a purposive character (pointing gestures, deictics,
pronomina or proper names in language). Symbols, finally, function by means of a habit
in mind or in nature, of connecting two otherwise unconnected entities to a sign.

Stjernfelt diverges from other accounts of the icon, however, in his assertion
that diagrams, as a visual manifestation of iconicity, create what he calls “iconical realism” (Stjernfelt 2007: xiv). He sees this way of construing icons as
“emancipating semiotics from the anti-scientific tendencies inherent in the
merely conventionalist sign approach . . ..” (Stjernfelt 2007: ix). And in this respect, Stjernfelt correctly highlights Peirce’s “anti-psychologism” (Stjernfelt
2014: 24–35; Cobley: 2019: 62). It is in these respects that parallels exist between
Stjernfelt and this current essay, but, crucially, he reaches his position through
quite different means. As highlighted, Stjernfelt focusses primarily on the second dimension in Figure 1 and the role of diagrams. These diagrams are hypoicons which provide information about the world, and they achieve this because
they are symbols in the third trichotomy. But symbols only have this power to
convey information because they already contain iconic and indexical signs. As
a result, Stjernfelt is quite correct in highlighting the ability of diagrams to deliver “iconical realism”, but his position becomes valid only because genuine
sign formation has already taken place. It is possible to view Stjernfelt’s discussion of the diagram, therefore, as complimenting the analysis here. The utility
of the diagram, which correctly Stjernfelt highlights, is, in fact, predicated on
the processes of sign formation elucidated in the following chapters.

9.3 Stjernfelt’s diagrammatology

147

Stjernfelt primary focus on diagrams has important effects on other aspects
of his interpretation of Peirce. He makes a clear distinction, for example, in the
first paragraph of his ‘Diagrammatology’, between icons and diagrams (Stjernfelt 2007: ix):
This treatise deals with the sign types of icons and diagrams. Icons understood as those
signs whose function as signs is due to some sort of similarity between them and their
objects – and diagrams as that special sort of icons which represent the internal structure
of those objects in terms of interrelated parts, facilitating reasoning possibilities.

Stjernfelt, therefore, distinguishes icons from diagrams. What makes diagrams
distinct is that they manifest more than similarity; they also “represent the internal structure” of reality. It is this feature that enables diagrams to offer what
Stjernfelt terms an “operational account of similarity” (Stjernfelt 2007: 206–211).
Diagrams are thus able to provide knowledge of the empirical world. Stjernfelt
states that “as soon as an icon is contemplated as a whole consisting of interrelated parts whose relations are subject to experimental change, we are operating
on a diagram” (Stjernfelt 2007: 92). There is, however, a problem in Stjernfelt’s
terminology here because he conflates his discussion of diagrams with that of
icons when, in fact, they are hypoicons. Stjernfelt makes this mistake because he
views diagrams as a subset of icons when, in fact, they should be held distinct
from the action of iconicity in the second trichotomy.
A primary feature of Stjernfelt’s diagrams, however, is their ability to form
a bridge across the divisions erected by dualism. Diagrams erase the gap between mental constructions and reality. As such, Stjernfelt concurs with Peirce
that human knowledge, based on mediating entities, abolishes such divisions.
However, in line with the conflation discussed above, Stjernfelt views the mediating element as being the diagram itself. He does not subscribe to the view,
proposed earlier, that the mediating element is the ‘object of thought’ present in
the sign. However, when such an ‘object of thought’ is finally manifested in a
diagram, one can agree with Stjernfelt that a mediating element is present. But it
should be emphasised that it is the ‘object of thought’, within the sign, which
provides mediation; the diagram simply illustrates it at a later stage.
Within Stjernfelt’s account of the diagram there also appears to be an implicit acceptance of ‘secondary dualism’. This emerges when Stjernfelt invokes
the notion of ‘mirroring’. Now using the term ‘icon’ rather than ‘diagram’, he
states “so, as soon as the icon consists of parts whose relations mirror the relations between the corresponding parts of the object, and the sign is used to
gain information about those parts and their interrelations, a diagram is at
stake” (Stjernfelt 2014: 207). This passage, focusing on the similarities between a

148

9 The received view of the Peircean icon

diagram and the world, echoes conventional interpretations of the icon. Stjernfelt,
therefore, whilst suggesting that diagrams enable the mind to cross the dualistic
divide, remains still curiously attached to it. The diagram, it seems, is positioned
by Stjernfelt as a means of overcoming dualism rather than dissolving it through
mediation. But Peirce, in fact, insists that such dualism is utterly mistaken in the
first place. He argues that semioticians should think in terms of mediating identities (e.g., ‘objects of thought’) which abolish this divide, and which can be subsequently depicted in diagrams.
Another important feature of Stjernfelt’s icon is its ability to convey knowledge of the predicates of an object. In many ways, Stjernfelt’s position on this
point is inevitable given his treatment of the diagram. If the latter provides
knowledge of what an object is like (operationally), then it will depict certain
qualities and predicates. As Stjernfelt maintains “because Icons are the means of
representing qualities, they generally constitute the predicative side of more complicated signs” (Stjernfelt 2007: 76). Likewise, he describes icons as “providing
the predicative, descriptive side of any signification process” (Stjernfelt 2007: 91).
But such a construal has implications for how Stjernfelt views iconicity; it
reinforces the secondary dualist influence that has already been noted in his
account and it narrows the icon to the role of conveying qualities and relations.
But, in the next chapter, it will be shown that this construal deprives iconicity of
its central role – that of creating putative identities (e.g., ‘objects of thought’)
which form the basis of empirical human knowledge. As such, icons deliver more
than knowledge of predicates; they create (within the second trichotomy) the potential subjects of propositions which are formed later in the third trichotomy.
Overall, Stjernfelt’s revision of the Peircean icon has many merits. It elevates the status of this particular sign type and provides the icon with a central
role in Peirce’s semiotics – something that is lacking in Eco’s account. Equally,
Stjernfelt reaches many of the same conclusions as the current essay regarding
the possibility of synthetic knowledge through his advocacy of ‘natural propositions’. However, he reaches such conclusions by asserting that diagrams, themselves, are the mediating entities which overcome the problems of dualism. He
diverges, therefore, from this current essay which suggests that ‘objects of
thought’, within the sign, play this mediating role. As a result, Stjernfelt’s
claims regarding ‘natural propositions’ find parallels in the following chapters,
but for reasons which are different from his own.
Discussion will now turn to a revised account of the Peircean icon. This will
involve defining what his icon is, what it does, and how it forms a cornerstone
of his sign theory. In so doing, the role of the icon in concept formation will be

9.3 Stjernfelt’s diagrammatology

149

evaluated in the context of Hegelian thought. As noted earlier, it will be suggested that the role of Peirce’s icon has parallels with the Hegelian Essence; it
represents an initial ‘guess’ at the nature of an indeterminate representamen.
As such, the icon forms the foundation for Peirce’s semiotic account of empirical concept formation.

10 Peirce: Concept formation in the second
trichotomy
10.1 Revising the Peircean icon
The revision of the icon proposed in this chapter is a cornerstone of the account
of Peircean concept formation outlined in this essay. The icon marks the point
where signs begin to involve the empirical world. It will be proposed that the
Peircean icon is ‘posited’ by the mind (on the basis of similarity) and that it acts
as a placeholder in the development of a ‘mediating’ concept – in the same way
as the Essence operates within Hegel’s system. As such, the icon represents the
first glimmerings of empirical human knowledge. In this respect, it is significant
that Peirce describes the activity of sign formation, outlined in Figure 1, as “speculative grammar” (EP2: 272). By using this terminology, Peirce acknowledges the
hypothetical nature of the knowledge offered at this point in the second trichotomy; the icon is speculative in nature.
To understand the role of the icon it is important to understand its position in
Peirce’s sign classification. Throughout the first trichotomy, there is still no ‘object
of thought’ involved in the sign. With the icon, however, signs reach this stage of
development; the icon is where ‘firstness’ (in the first horizontal row) intersects
with an ‘object of thought’ (in the second column). One of the key characteristics
of a ‘first’, as noted, is that it represents a possibility, and this is precisely what the
icon is. But, secondly, the position of the icon in his classification entails something else as well; an icon, as a ‘first’, is also monadic in nature. This strongly
indicates that the icon should not be viewed as a relationship between dyadic entities. Instead, it should be understood as a single entity. But the idea that the icon
involves two similar things is, of course, what critics of Peirce assume – they believe the icon creates a relationship between an external object and a sign. This
leads to an important question; how does Peirce combine the idea of similarity
with the icon’s monadic status? The answer to this problem is critical to understanding the icon.
Fundamentally, the icon provides the mind with a first guess at reality. The
intellect experiences a perceptual ‘vague’ and ‘posits’ an ‘object of thought’. At
this point, however, the mind still does not know what the ‘object of thought’
might be; it is merely a likeness. This is important; Peirce is using the term ‘likeness’ in a particular manner. He is not asserting that a specific, and verifiable,
similarity exists between two known entities. Instead, he is suggesting that the
mind entertains, with an icon, a vague recognition that two perceptions might
be like each other. It represents a minimal level of knowledge; a hypothesis

10.1 Revising the Peircean icon

151

that an ‘object of thought’ might exist, as a particular identity. As Peirce clearly
states, “a pure icon can convey no positive or factual information; for it affords
no assurance that there is any such thing in nature” (CP4: 447).
In identifying a similarity, a putative ‘object of thought’ is picked out from
the Phaneron. It might be objected that Peirce is now contradicting himself. He
maintains, in his account of ‘perceptual judgments’, that the mind cannot compare its perceptual judgments; instead, they simply replace each other. How,
then, can the mind identify a potential resemblance between two of them? Peirce’s answer, however, that it is the ‘perceptual judgment’ itself which draws
these two percepts together; ‘perceptual judgments’ always form a class. As a result, the icon is, essentially, a ‘perceptual judgment’ drawn into the signifying
process – in the same way that a qualisign is a percept drawn into a sign.
This interpretation of the icon can be traced back to philosophers within
the tradition of German Idealism. It was observed earlier that Eco makes a link
between the icon and the Kantian ‘schema’, but it was also noted that he mistakenly identifies the schema with the structures of ‘secondary dualism’. In
contrast, within German Idealism, Schelling insists that schemas form perceptual classifications (Schelling [1800] 1978: 137):
In the commonest exercise of the understanding, the schema figures as the general link
whereby we recognise any object as of a certain sort.

A schema, therefore, brings two perceptions together under a single class. It
does not compare two separate perceptions, and this is also true of the Peircean
icon.
The classificatory nature of the schema also helps explain the icon’s monadic
status. Considering another quotation from Peirce, he states that “each Icon partakes of some more or less overt character of its Object” (CP4: 531). The verb
Peirce uses here – partakes – is an important one. If ‘A’ partakes of ‘B’ then ‘A’
shares something with ‘B’. This is not, therefore, a dyadic relationship between
two separate entities, but rather the sharing of one identity. To illustrate this
point, if I see John today, and then see the same John tomorrow, I do not assume
(unless I am Hume) that a dyadic relationship exists between two ‘Johns’. Instead,
I believe that they are one and the same John; they share the same identity. When
discussing the concept of similarity, Peirce argues that iconic resemblance is this
kind of relationship. He states that “suggestion by resemblance is easily enough
understood, as soon as the conception is once grasped that the similitude of two
ideas consists in the fact that the mind naturally joins them together in thought in
a certain way” (CP7: 392). And elsewhere, Peirce talks about two experiences of
the colour blue: “some beginner may object that they have both a blueness in
them; but I reply that blueness is nothing but the idea of these sensations and of

152

10 Peirce: Concept formation in the second trichotomy

others I have had, thrown together and indistinctly thought of at once. Blueness
is the idea of a class” (CP7: 392). And elsewhere Peirce argues that “identity is
essentially a dual relation” (CP1: 446).
What Peirce proposes, therefore, is that in an iconic resemblance, the mind
experiences two phenomena as one thing; it encounters them, in a ‘perceptual
judgment’, as members of a class. The intellect does not perceive two separate
known things and compare them; instead, it has an experience of two things
together as a monadic ‘object of thought’. Peirce supports this when he claims
(CP7: 498):
This sort of association by virtue of which certain kinds of ideas become naturally allied,
as crimson and scarlet, is called association by resemblance. The name is not a good
one, since it implies that the resemblance causes the association, while in point of fact it
is the association which constitutes the resemblance.

Elsewhere, Peirce also defines what he means by resemblance – the combining of
different experiences into one identity. He suggests that “resemblance is an identity of characters; and this is the same as to say that the mind gathers the resembling ideas together into one conception” (EP1: 254). Peirce’s critics, therefore,
utterly miss their intended target. They challenge whether a similarity can be established between two known identities, but Peirce is embarked on an entirely
different theoretical enterprise. With his icon, he maintains that similarity forms
the basis of putative identity; he does not claim that two separate identities can
be judged as being the same.
This analysis of the Peircean icon also parallels the treatment of reality encountered in Leibniz. There, it was observed that monads are the sum of their
relationships with the world. They do not, therefore, have an identity and then
have relationships with other monads; instead, their identity is formed as the
sum of those relationships. This model can be applied to the Peircean icon. It is
not a similarity established between two previously known identities – it is an
identity that is formed by their relationship of similarity.
Murphey accurately grasps Peirce’s position on the icon, and referring to
Peirce’s passage on ‘blueness’ cited above, observes (Murphey 1993: 340):
The class concept of blue is a general idea which forms a connection among sensations,
but the general idea does not produce those associations – rather it is an idea of the sensations which the mind groups together. It is the fact that the mind connects these ideas
which makes them similar – not their similarity which leads the mind to connect them.

These insights into the icon also find parallels in Hegel, who argues that the
mind fixes an element in the indeterminacy of ‘Being’ by positing an Essence.
In the ‘Phenomenology of Spirit’, Hegel explicitly links this act of ‘positing’ to
the creation of an ‘object’. He argues that “one of the terms is posited in sense-

10.1 Revising the Peircean icon

153

certainty in the form of a simple, immediate being, or as the essence, the object
. . . .” (Hegel 1977: 59). Hegel’s Essence, therefore, represents the mind’s attempt to ‘fix’ reality.
There is one key difference, however, between the Peircean icon and the
Hegelian Essence which explains their disagreement regarding secondness. For
Peirce, the icon is a nascent identity, which has no content, whilst Hegel’s Essence is already replete with empirical content and the inner contradictions
which require dialectical resolution. This is why Hegel has no need for ‘secondness’; reality is already encapsulated within the Essence. For Peirce, in contrast, the icon still needs to be ‘filled out’ at an empirical level and this, as will
be seen shortly, is the role of the index.
The necessity to ‘fill out’ the icon introduces another feature of it; its purity.
Peirce sometimes talks of the icon in these terms because of its stripped-down
character.39 A ‘pure’ icon, for Peirce, is one that simply captures a form or a
‘suchness’. He states, for example, that “a pure icon does not draw any distinction between itself and its object. It represents whatever it may represent, and,
whatever it is like, it in so far is. It is an affair of suchness only” (EP2: 163). Peirce
also states, elsewhere, that “no pure Icons represent anything but Forms; no
pure Forms are represented by anything but Icons” (CP4: 544). And Murphey
concurs again with this interpretation, when he concludes that “what Peirce
calls an icon then is a sign which expresses the form of its object, and hence it
may stand for any object which has a given form” (Murphey 1993: 233–234). A
pure icon is thus a form without empirical content; it has, as a result, a ‘dreamlike’ quality (EP1: 226):
So, in contemplating a painting, there is a moment when we lose the consciousness that
it is not the thing, the distinction of the real and the copy disappears, and it is for the
moment a pure dream, – not in any particular existence, and yet not general. At that moment we are contemplating an icon.

Another aspect of the icon is its relationship with the imagination. If the mind
forms its ‘perceptual judgments’ based on perceived similarity, then it is the
imagination which allows such activity to take place. Before Peirce, Kant can

39 The idea of ‘purity’ has already been encountered in Hegel when he described the nature
of Being. Confronted by the indeterminacy of Being, Hegel claims (1892/2014: 101) that “pure
Being makes the beginning: because it is on the one hand pure thought, and on the other immediacy itself, simple and indeterminate; and the first beginning cannot be mediated by anything, or be further determined”. Purity is thus associated by Hegel with this initial stage in
concept formation where the mind grasps an Essence. It is a way of describing the experience
of Being before dialecticism, or secondness (in the case of Peirce), become involved.

154

10 Peirce: Concept formation in the second trichotomy

thus be found emphasising the role of the imagination in concept formation
(Kant 1998: 211):
Synthesis in general is, as we shall subsequently see, the mere effect of the imagination,
of a blind though indispensable function of the soul, without which we would have no
cognition at all, but of which we are seldom ever conscious. Yet to bring this synthesis to
concepts is a function that pertains to the understanding, and by means of which it first
provides cognition in the proper sense.

It is the imagination, therefore, that brings perceptions together in monadic
classes and creates Peircean icons. The Kantian imagination does not operate
on previously received (or known) sense data. Rather, it is involved, at an earlier stage, in perceptual activity itself. In this context, Strawson (1982: 84)
points out that Kant uses the term ‘imagination’ in a particular way:
Kant declares the schema to be a product of, and also a rule for, the imagination, in accordance with which, and by means of which alone, the imagination can connect the particular image or the particular object with the general concept under which it falls.

And this view of Kant is supported by Freydberg (2005: 95) who argues that “in
theoretical reasoning, our fragmented intuitions are brought to the unity of
pure concepts of the understanding by means of the synthesis of imagination”.
This role for the imagination is relevant to later discussions. For Hegel and
Peirce, reason and logic are critical to concept formation, but these factors are always balanced by the role of the imagination. It is this human faculty which allows both of their systems to retain creativity and spontaneity. And this feature of
concept formation also re-emerges in Vygotsky when he considers the role of play.
The idea of the icon can also be identified in the early modern period, but, in
these centuries, alternative language is used to describe it. Deely observes, for example, that Fonseca has two types of signs – the ‘formal’ and the ‘instrumental’.40
Deely suggests that the former should be equated to the icon, whilst the latter corresponds to the index. Fonseca states (and note his use of the term ‘object’):
Formal signs are similitudes or certain forms (species) of things signified inscribed within
the cognitive powers, by means of which the things signified are perceived . . . . These
signs are called ‘formal’ because they form and as it were structure the knowing power.
Instrumental signs are those which, having become objects for knowing powers, lead to

40 Deely suggests that Poinsot, in the early seventeenth century, possesses an equivalent of
the Peircean icon. In Poinsot’s ‘Tractatus de Signis’, the icon is present in the guise of the
‘idolum’. Deely states that “the closest English word to Poinsot’s use of idolum is the term
‘icon’ as semiotically defined by C.S. Peirce” (Deely 2013: 241).

10.1 Revising the Peircean icon

155

the cognition of something else. Of this sort is the track of an animal left in the ground,
smoke, a statue, and the like.
(Fonseca 1564: I.I. cap. VIII. (Quoted in Deely 2009a: 183–184))

In the early modern period, therefore, Fonseca views the ‘formal’ sign41 as
something which “structures the knowing power”.42 This clearly foreshadows
the role of the Hegelian Essence because the latter acts as a starting point for
concept development. Osborne also agrees with this interpretation and, when
discussing Poinsot, states that the formal sign differs from an instrumental sign
because it acts as a “medium” (Osborne 2010: 9):
The formal sign causes the knowledge of the significate by representing it. But this sign is
not an efficient cause. It acts in the place of the object and shares the formal causality of
the object. Its representation takes place by a medium in which (in quo), whereas instrumental representation takes place by a medium through which (per quod).

Such comments thus support the view that the icon shares features with the premodern notion of ‘form’ (or essence). The icon permits an ‘object of thought’ to
become present in the mind as an initialising identity. It does this by providing a

41 The notion of ‘form’ is an important one to Peirce and critical to understanding his icon.
However, Peirce seldom uses this term, and he also seems reluctant to invoke the associated
idea of ‘formal cause’. Instead, he prefers to talk in terms of objects having ‘habits’. Peirce is
known for advocating the Aristotelian concept of ‘final cause’ in the teleological aspects of
human knowledge (Short 2007: 91–144), but he seldom mentions the idea of ‘formal cause’.
Indeed, sometimes he only identifies two types of causation – ‘efficient’ and ‘final’ cause (EP2:
120). This seems to be a potentially important omission in his thought. Joseph Ransdell also
views this as puzzling, and he attempts to include the notion of formal cause in Peircean
thought (Ransdell 2013: 541–552). Overall, the idea of formal cause is anathema to nominalists.
It asserts that things behave according to their identities. In section 13.1 it will be noted that
this perspective is implicit in Peirce’s pragmatism because he proposes that objects behave
according to their ‘whole conceptions’. Such identities are established, of course, based on experience. Indeed, Peirce even describes ‘substances’ as “bundles of habits” (CP1: 414). Overall,
Peirce’s view that objects possess ‘habits’ seems to be closest he comes an invocation of formal
cause. He may have decided that the latter was too radical a step.
42 A parallel to the icon which “structures the knowing power” can be found in Vygotsky.
When an icon creates the initial starting point of an ‘object of thought’, it defines the trajectory
of its later evolution. This parallels Vygotsky, who talks of words creating ‘pathways’ along
which concepts develop. To support the view that a sign must involve the creation of a ‘form’,
it is also worth quoting Peirce’s letter to Lady Welby in the spring of 1906 (EP2: 477). In the
very first line he states: “I use the word ‘Sign’ in the widest sense for any medium for the communication or extension of a Form (or feature)” He immediately goes on to say (EP2: 477):
“The Form (and the Form is the Object of the Sign), as it really determines the former Subject,
is quite independent of the sign; yet we may and indeed must say that the object of a sign can
be nothing but what that sign represents it to be”.

156

10 Peirce: Concept formation in the second trichotomy

‘medium’ in which the ‘object’ is for the first time conceptualised as a placeholder. For Fonseca, as for Peirce, this initiating ‘form’ has no empirical (e.g., instrumental) content; it is a putative identity (e.g., an ‘object of thought’) without
empirical trappings.
In summary, icons represent the mind’s first attempts to establish empirical
forms of knowledge – in the shape of posited ‘forms’, or identities. This construal
challenges the conventional view that the icon represents a recognised similarity
between two known identities.
In our earlier discussions of Stjernfelt, it was also highlighted that he emphasises the capacity of the icon to convey knowledge about predicates and likenesses. But it is now clear that, in fact, the role of the Peircean icon is much
broader than this; it is iconicity that has the power to establish ‘objects of thought’.
And this necessarily involves subjects as well as predicates. The icon, therefore,
begins the process of bridging Cartesian Dualism by establishing a mediating ‘object of thought’ in the sign. As merely posited identities, icons always remain hypotheses, but they mark the intellect’s first step towards synthetic knowledge of
the empirical world.

10.2 Peirce on indices
The icon initiates an ‘object of thought’ by positing a monadic identity around
which further empirical knowledge can develop. The newly formed icon, however,
remains an indeterminate ‘possibility’. It is the index, in developing the icon,
which establishes empirical relationships between this hypothesised identity and
the world making it more determinate, more actual, and more real.
It is worth briefly re-visiting the ‘received’ notion of the index that was
highlighted earlier. For there are, again, considerable differences between this received view and the one being proposed here. The former dualistically invokes a
link between an index (in the mind) and an ‘object’ (in the world). For example, a
perception of smoke is construed as an indexical sign of fire (which is its cause).
Likewise. a high temperature is seen as an indexical sign of fever. The indexical
sign, in this view, indicates ‘connections’ which are thought to exist in reality. But
it is important to ask how such indexical links also inform the activity of concept
formation.
On the surface, an index establishes a link between two known entities
(e.g., smoke and fire). For Hume, such a link is a matter of constant conjunction
which, over time, forms a ‘habit’ in the mind. But there must be something incorrect if this Humean interpretation is applied to the Peircean index because,
as highlighted earlier, such causal links are only established by ‘thirds’. And,

10.2 Peirce on indices

157

with the index, our analysis is still focused on the dyadic relationships involving secondness. So, what role do indices play in concept formation?
When Peirce gives the example of a weathercock as an ‘index’ of the wind,
he is not simply claiming that the index gives us knowledge of a causal relation
(existing over time) between the wind and the weathercock. What he is asserting,
instead, is that the movement of the weathercock is an indexical property of the
wind. It enables us to learn something about the wind (as an emerging ‘object of
thought’); being able to move a weathercock becomes one of the wind’s attributes
(EP2: 14). So, indices, by themselves, do not tell us about causal laws. They
merely force us to notice momentary connections in the world and to include
them, or not, within an emerging ‘object of thought’. The ‘received’ view of the
index, therefore, actually runs ahead of itself in assuming that indices represent
causal knowledge. Such understanding is possible, of course, once a ‘third’ has
been created and an index is included within it. But the index, alone, does not
convey such causal knowledge. Earlier, it was noted that Hookway discusses
some missing tree bark. He stated that “it is probably only because we know what
the deer do to the bark of trees that we take the tree as a sign of a deer” (Hookway
1985: 123). But this account of the index reverses how it operates in concept formation. Hookway is using his prior knowledge of the world (e.g., the behaviour of
deer) to establish an indexical sign – when, in fact, the indexical sign should be
helping us explain the world.
An index acts, therefore, to tell us which properties are included, or not included, within a particular identity. It does this by saying, as it were, ‘Look! this is
included!’ and ‘No! this is not included!’. And the index accomplishes this through
the action of secondness. As such, the index not only establishes the empirical
contents of the emerging identity, but it simultaneously places that identity in the
world through the connections that it establishes. A sign thus becomes progressively more embedded in the world, as more linkages are created, and the sign
moves from a hypothesis to being a useful ‘tool’ to understand the world. Indices,
therefore, determine the empirical contents of an ‘object of thought’ and create
conceptual outcomes which echo the ‘distinct ideas’ of the early modern period.
Leibniz defined these ideas in terms of the intellect’s ability to distinguish their
contents. And in Peirce’s sign theory it is the index that provides this kind of
knowledge by ‘filling out’ the identity initiated by the icon. As Peirce explains, this
brings “to the interpreter the experience of the very object denoted” (EP2: 307):
It will be observed that the icon is very perfect in respect to signification, bringing its interpreter face to face with the very character signified. For this reason, it is the mathematical sign par excellence. But in denotation it is wanting. It gives no assurance that any
such object as it represents really exists. The index on the other hand does this most

158

10 Peirce: Concept formation in the second trichotomy

perfectly, actually bringing to the interpreter the experience of the very object denoted.
But it is quite wanting in signification unless it involves an iconic part.

The Peircean index can also be compared with Hegel. The philosophical roots
of Peirce’s icon can be found in the latter’s work, and it is unsurprising to find
an equivalent of Peircean indexicality there as well. However, Hegel views the
mechanisms through which reality impacts on an emerging concept quite differently. Because he already assumes that Essences contain empirical linkages,
Hegel insists that dialecticism must clarify their exact relationships. Referencing Kant’s ‘Antimonies’, he states that (Hegel 2014: 63):
Here it will be sufficient to say that the Antimonies are not confined to the four special
objects taken from Cosmology: they appear in all objects of every kind, in all conceptions,
notions and Ideas. To be aware of this and to know objects in this property of theirs,
makes a vital part in a philosophical theory. For the property thus indicated is what we
shall afterwards describe as the Dialectical influence in logic.

Hegel, therefore, agrees with Kant that the contradictions in human thought
need to be resolved. But he differs from him in extending the Antimonies to his
dialecticism. As Stern (1990: 57) points out:
For, whereas Kant had diagnosed the antimonies as being caused by our attempt to know
something beyond experience, Hegel argues that the antimonies are generated by understanding’s insistence on thinking in terms of one sided and mutually exclusive categories,
so that it cannot settle on the correctness of either one or the other of them, but instead
oscillates between them both.

Hegel thus believes that it is dialecticism which is central to an understanding
of how objects (of thought) relate to each other in the world (Hegel: [1830]
1894: 420):
Consciousness, having passed beyond the sensibility wants to take the object in its truth,
not as merely immediate, but as mediated, reflected in itself, and universal. Such an object is a combination of sense qualities with attributes of wider range by which thought
defines concrete relations and connections.

Hegel’s dialecticism thus determines empirical connections in the world as they
emerge within human concepts. This equates to the indexical stage of concept development for Peirce. But because the two processes have different start points,
they appear to be quite different from each other. Hegel, beginning with Essences,
wants to eradicate the contradictions which they may contain. In contrast, Peirce,
starting with icons, as ‘pure’ forms, wants to add empirical relationships through
indexical links. But both philosophers seek the same outcome – a system of mediating concepts which both converge on the world and relate to each other.

10.3 Peirce on symbols

159

In summary, the Peircean index, still operating in the second trichotomy,
develops the ‘object of thought’ initially posited by the icon. It renders the
emerging sign more determinate, more concrete, and it makes the sign a more
effective ‘tool’ to understand the world. Conventionally, the index is simply
seen as relationship between an object in the world and a sign. In contrast, for
Peirce, the index is the sign type which enables an ‘object of thought’ to develop
through the actions of secondness. And the outcomes of such indexical activity
are relationally defined identities based on empirical experience of the world.
Ransdell thus maintains that “Peirce’s semiotic is not about a class of objects. It is
about what it is to be an object” (Ransdell 1976: 99). The indexical stage is central
to establishing such knowledge; the indices are how the on-going determination
of an ‘object’ takes place.
But, as highlighted above, the index can only achieve so much. It cannot
encompass the next level in sign creation where ‘thirds’ are created, and causal
laws are established. This next stage in ‘the natural history of the sign’ is reached
with the development of the symbol. It is only at this point that the sign evolves
into what Peirce calls a ‘genuine’ sign.

10.3 Peirce on symbols
With the symbol, the last stage of the second trichotomy is reached. Here, the
evolving ‘object of thought’ encounters thirdness. As noted, this entails an ‘object of thought’ becoming conceptualised as a new identity, or as a causal law,
which also exists in the world. ‘Thirds’ exist as ‘objects of thought’ (such as the
idea of ‘murder’), even when they possess no corresponding, or direct, sense
datum of their own. Equally, they can also exist irrespective of whether an actual
symbol has been adopted (by a culture) to represent them. It is possible, as a result, for an individual to have a particular sense of ‘giving’ which has no actual
word in their language to describe it. In a very real sense, therefore, these ‘objects of thought’, within the sign, stand under the symbols formed in the second
trichotomy and so inform the mind’s understanding of them.
Such an account is clearly very different from the ‘received’ view of the symbol. Within the tradition of modern semiology, the defining features of the symbol are its arbitrary and conventional characteristics. As Fiske reminds us “in a
symbol there is no connection or resemblance between sign and object: a symbol
communicates only because people agree that it shall stand for what it does”
(Fiske 1990: 46). Likewise, Hodge and Kress (1988: 21–22) claim that a symbol is
“a merely conventional link, as in Saussure’s ‘arbitrary’ sign”, and Corrington

160

10 Peirce: Concept formation in the second trichotomy

states that “symbols refer to generals rather than to particulars and have a conventional or arbitrary relation to their referents” (Corrington 1993: 164).
In this received view, the arbitrary nature of the symbol leads to the idea
that it can stand for anything that a culture chooses. But this position involves a
critical misunderstanding of Peirce’s sign classification. For it has already been
noted that this type of arbitrary sign does exist for Peirce, but as a legisign. Positioned in the first trichotomy, the legisign does not involve an empirical ‘object
of thought’. As such, it can stand for anything, and it is subject to conventional
rules. Peircean symbols, however, are more than legisigns because reality has
played a role in their formation (at the indexical stage). It follows from this that
Peircean symbols are not just conventional sign types. He makes this clear in a
passage that modern semioticians sometimes gloss over (EP2: 269):
Many philosophers say they are ‘mere symbols’. Take away the word mere and this is
true. They are symbols; and symbols being the only things in the universe that have any
importance, the word ‘mere’ is a great impertinence. In short, wherever there is thought
there is Thirdness.

Peirce accepts, of course, that the actual visual, or auditory, manifestation of a
symbol is a matter of cultural choice. And a culture will suggest that certain
symbols are more suited to stand for certain meanings than others (green, for
example is chosen to stand for environmental issues because it reflects the colour of trees etc). But this is quite different to the Saussurean claim that a sign’s
meaning is arbitrary. And Peirce’s position clearly has important implications
for the status of words and language. In another passage, he states that “the
word itself has no existence, although it has a real being, consisting in the fact
that existents will conform to it” (EP2: 274). So, Peirce asserts, and radically so,
that reality conforms to human words because, as symbols, words represent
identities that have been previously fashioned by reality. This is possible because
symbols contain ‘objects of thought’ which have already developed in the sign. It
these underlying ‘objects of thought’ which are, in fact, the bearers of meaning
and not words themselves. In a very real sense, therefore, words do not have
meanings; meanings have words. This position clearly challenges the framework
of ‘secondary dualism’ where the mind enjoys the privilege of creating the meanings of words. As Nöth observes “replicas of symbols in their acoustic or written
form are indeed lifeless things . . . but symbols as genuine thirdness live on as
self-replicative beings” (Nöth 2014a: 180).
This Peircean rejection of the nominalist position is seldom fully grasped
by scholars – even though some sense the direction in which Peirce is moving.
Corrington, for example, recognising the underlying direction of Peirce’s argument, reflects on what Peirce seems to be suggesting: “this tension remains

10.3 Peirce on symbols

161

unresolved in Peirce although I am increasingly persuaded that he was struggling toward a nonconventionalist understanding of how symbols function to
unveil objective and generic features of nature” (Corrington 1993: 145). This,
however, is precisely what Peirce is proposing. Symbols do “unveil objective
and generic features of nature” and they do this because they stand for their
underlying ‘objects of thought’. Elsewhere, Peirce also repeats his rejection of
the received view in an unpublished manuscript (MS: 1105), quoted by Rosenthal, when he states that “meaning enters into language by determining it”
(Rosenthal 1994: 147n). The meaning of an ‘object of thought’ thus determines
the entailments of a word; the word does not specify its own meaning.
A symbol is thus a sign type which encapsulates the meaning (e.g., the indexical attributes) of an ‘object of thought’. In so doing, it becomes a mental ‘tool’
The human intellect can now consider identities in the world, such as social phenomena (e.g., murder), molecules, the law of gravity, or mathematical relations in
ways that capture their complex relationships. In what is one of his most insightful descriptions of sign action, Peirce thus asserts that “it appears to me that the
essential function of a sign is to render inefficient relations efficient” (SS: 31).
Symbols, echoing Stjernfelt’s diagrams, facilitate human understanding of the
world.
Earlier, in discussion of Peirce’s category of thirdness, the role of Hegelian
‘sublation’ was highlighted. It is now possible to link the notion of sublation with
the evolution of symbols. Sublation enables a representamen to accrue a new
meaning whilst still preserving its experiential content. Sublation can, for example, turn a metal ring into a sign of love. This semiotic transformation preserves
the experiential element of an emerging concept, but, at the same time, ‘lifts it up’
to create a new identity (a ‘third’). When this takes place, the indexical associations previously accrued by an icon are no longer just linked to it by association.
Instead, they are now contained within the meaning of the sign. This evolutionary
process takes place in three stages:
– Stage One: the icon is formed as a putative identity (X)
– Stage Two: the icon (X) gathers indexical associations ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, ‘d’
At the third stage, sublation occurs and this inverts the relationship of the
elements:
– Stage Three: ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, ‘d’ now become signs of ‘X’. ‘As a result, X’ is a
‘third’ because, when ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, and ‘d’ are observed, the presence of ‘X’
can be inferred from them. A symbol, or genuine sign, has now been formed.

10 Peirce: Concept formation in the second trichotomy

In our earlier example of the New York taxis, this is how these particular cars
become signs of that city rather than just vehicles with particular associations.
It can be argued, therefore, that Hegelian sublation is how the meaning of a
symbol is formed. And it is possible to connect this transformation to another
important feature of the Peircean sign. In our discussion of ‘thirds’ it was emphasised that an interpretant involves seeing something, not just ‘as something’,
but rather ‘as something else’. This is precisely the effect of sublation. Because
symbols are ‘thirds’, they contain the indices which, previously, have just been
associated with a sign. After sublation takes place, however, the mind ‘perceives’
these indices through the symbol; it allows the intellect to ‘see something as
something else’. Peirce seldom uses the term ‘concept’ in his writings, preferring
to talk in terms of ‘signs’. But in his discussion of symbols (in the third category),
he uses this term to describe ‘genuine signs’ (EP2: 10):
Symbols grow. They come into being by development out of other signs, particularly from
likenesses or from mixed signs partaking of the nature of likenesses and symbols. We
think only in signs. These mental signs are of mixed nature; the symbol-parts of them are
called concepts. If a man makes a new symbol, it is by thoughts involving concepts. So it
is only out of symbols that a new symbol can grow. Omne symbolum de symbolo. A symbol, once in being, spreads among the peoples. In use and in experience, its meaning
grows. Such words as force, law, wealth, marriage, bear for us very different meanings
from those they bore to our barbarous ancestors.

It is also essential to understand how symbols work within a cultural environment. In our analysis of thirdness, it was noted that ‘giving’ involves more than
the simple passing of an object from one person to another. As a concept, it
begins its ‘natural history’ with the hypothesis, by an individual, that there is
more to this apparently dyadic activity than meets the eye. The individual
forms an icon and, in doing so, they posit a potential identity in the world. As
this icon accrues indexical properties, the concept of ‘giving’ establishes particular social connections. The individual notices, for example, that ‘giving’ takes
place on birthdays, or at festivals, and that it involves wrapping things in ribbon.
The individual may also grasp that ‘giving’ involves one person saying certain
things, in certain ways, and that this may, in turn, elicit particular responses
from a receiver. All these features create a network of indexical properties for the
evolving sign. At this stage, however, a symbol has yet to be created. This only
happens when sublation takes place and these accrued indices are transformed
into a sign of giving. At this point, the symbol establishes a set of social ‘rules’
which determine what ‘giving’ involves. These behaviours, in turn, need to be
evidenced by any ‘giver’ if a particular act is to be recognised by others as an act
of ‘giving’.

10.3 Peirce on symbols

163

However, if a particular individual displays the ‘wrong’ indices (e.g., they use
the ‘wrong’ wrapping paper, or say the ‘wrong’ things), then an ‘act of giving’ may
not be recognised by observers. The role of Peircean secondness is important here
because it illustrates how meanings, contained in symbols, can spread through a
culture without any overt discussion taking place amongst its members. Social
‘rules’ tend, instead, to be enforced through the impact of ‘cultural’ secondness,
when an individual’s actions are either accepted by others as manifestations of
particular ‘thirds’, or they are rejected because they fail to instantiate the requisite
indexical signs. It is important to emphasise, however, that social meanings are
not created through any tacit agreement, or consensus, between individuals. They
are created as individually formed concepts running up against the secondness of
others. Certainly, this interaction is a social activity, but it does not equate to a
claim that meanings are socially constructed. Indeed, Peirce argues that initial
concept formation is essentially an individual affair. Only the subsequent negotiation of the meaning of a symbol becomes social – when individuals encounter the
meanings that others have formed and are forced to qualify their own. But this is a
smaller claim for constructivists to maintain.
The meanings of symbols are, of course, never fixed. The precise way in
which they evolve can be better understood by considering semiosis in diagrammatic terms (Figure 11). To use the example above, an individual may create
a concept of ‘giving’ and, once this has happened, they will encounter similar examples of this activity in their daily life. At this point, acts of ‘giving’ will be perceived as ‘thirds’ (as symbols with indexical content), but, crucially, they will also
be experienced as icons (because the symbols will be like behaviours that have
been seen before). These new experiences may confirm the nature of ‘giving’, or
they may, instead, initiate new icons and new forms of ‘giving’. A ‘natural history
of the sign’ will thus develop. New indexical determinations may be added to the
symbol, or secondness may force an individual to distinguish between different
kinds of ‘giving’. For example, they may begin to distinguish between acts of ‘giving’ at a child’s birthday party and ‘giving’ at a wedding. It is this constant evolution of the sign that Peirce calls ‘semiosis’. It involves a semiotic development of
the sign itself through its successive determinations and repeated cycles of the
icon/index/symbol stages. This can be contrasted with the more conventional
view which views semiosis as repeated acts of interpretation by different interpreters. As Romanini affirms “semeiosis means ‘action of the sign’ and not action
of the interpreter” (Romanini 2014: 227).43 And this also means that, in a Peircean

43 Romanini develops his own version of semiosis which he calls a ‘Solenoid of Semeiosis’.
This is explained in his paper ‘Semeiosis as a Living Process’ (Romanini 2014: 228–236). His

164

10 Peirce: Concept formation in the second trichotomy

perspective, semiosis entails the constant refining, and further determination, of
signs as they converge on reality. In the hands of modern semioticians, in contrast, if they adopt the notion of interpretation to drive semiosis, there is every
possibility that signs will become increasingly detached from reality and with
more distorted meanings.

Figure 11: Semiosis as the Interaction of Peirce’s Three Categories and the Three Elements
of the Sign.

Peirce, therefore, does not accept the twentieth century view that meaning is
constructed within the social sphere. He maintains, instead, that symbols are
first formed by the individual through sublation. These meanings are certainly
negotiated, at a later stage, within the social environment, but that they are not
originated there.
Whilst Peirce maintains that the meanings of symbols are fine-tuned in the
‘outward clash’, he also recognises that individuals often manage to converse
with each other without understanding all the indexical components that symbols

account differs, however, from the account outlined in Figure 11 because he focuses on the
development of the immediate and dynamic ‘objects of thought’, rather than on the interactions of Peirce’s categories.

10.3 Peirce on symbols

165

contain. For example, he describes two men conversing in a railway carriage
(CP5: 448n):
Suppose, for example, two Englishmen to meet in a continental railway carriage . . . . If
one mentions Charles the Second, the other need not consider what possible Charles
the Second is meant. It is no doubt the English Charles the Second. Charles the Second of
England was quite a different man on different days; and it might be said that without
further specification the subject is not identified. But the two Englishmen have no purpose in splitting hairs in their talk; and the latitude of interpretation which constitutes
the indeterminacy of a sign must be understood as a latitude which might affect the
achievement of a purpose.

Human discourse is thus possible even when two individuals do not know the
exact contents of the symbols used by others. This discursive activity takes place
in the dimension of ‘speculative rhetoric’ (see Figure 1) which Peirce he defines
as the “transmission of meaning by signs from mind to mind” (CP1: 444). In conversation, therefore, each individual needs to make sure that their listener, or
reader, grasps the indexical entailments that may be contained within the symbols they use. Peirce observes that (CP3: 433–434):
When an assertion is made, there really is some speaker, writer, or other sign-maker who
delivers it; and he supposes there is, or will be, some hearer, reader, or other interpreter
who will receive it. It may be a stranger upon a different planet, an aeon later; or it may
be that very same man as he will be a second after . . . . . .
The assertion which the deliverer seeks to convey to the mind of the receiver relates
to some object or objects which have forced themselves upon his attention; and he will
miss his mark altogether unless he can succeed in forcing those very same objects upon
the attention of the receiver.

In human discourse, therefore, the speaker/writer ‘forces’ the contents of their
own symbols upon others. In a conversation each speaker must try to establish
what is included, and what is not included, within their own symbols. In this activity, a degree of indeterminacy will always be involved. As will be discussed, in
the third trichotomy, Peirce calls these words ‘terms’; they sit in the part of his
sign classification where symbols revert to being vague ‘firsts’. In conversation,
this indeterminacy is always present, but it can also be resolved. But this does
not mean that communication entails a ‘transmission’ of thought. As Stjernfelt
correctly points out, it is difficult to see how such a process could possibly work.
He asks, “how are we to establish the meaning of a lexeme if it consists in nothing but millions of vague, fleeting, instantaneous mental events which we are
only able to address via the insecure roundabout of trusting people’s own introspective reports about their own mental experiences?” (Stjernfelt 2014: 15). In
contrast, Peirce’s communication model is far more credible; meaning is first

166

10 Peirce: Concept formation in the second trichotomy

formed by individuals themselves and then it is revised in conversation with
others.
It is not surprising, of course, to find that this Peircean account of the symbol,
and human communication, has roots in Hegel. The latter maintains that an individual, in their own activity of concept formation, can only establish a subjective
perspective – if only because they cannot experience every way in which a concept
is manifested in the world. To achieve a fuller understanding of a concept, therefore, the individual needs the involvement of others. For example, Hegel suggests
that “the Idea is the Truth: for Truth is the correspondence of objectivity with the
notion: – not of course the correspondence of external things with my conceptions, – for these are only correct conceptions held by me, the individual person”.
And in the same passage (Hegel 2014: 229), he goes on to state that:
Every individual being is some one aspect of the Idea: for which, therefore, yet other actualities are needed, which in their turn appear to have a self-subsistence of their own. It is
only in them altogether and in their relation that the notion is realised. The individual by
itself does not correspond to its notion. It is this limitation of its existence which constitutes the finitude and the ruin of the individual.

An individual, therefore, only possesses a partial understanding of the relational aspects of an ‘Idea’. If this position is to be attenuated, the individual
must participate in human discourse. For Hegel, the social realm is, therefore,
critical in the development of meaning. Conversational access to the perspectives of others is what prevents “the ruin of the individual”. But Hegel is not
suggesting, at this point, that meanings are made by culture. All that he, and
indeed Peirce, are claiming is that the social dimension refines an individual’s
concepts by providing greater perspectives on them – a dynamic that is rooted
in the relational view of reality that they both espouse.
It is also worth highlighting that, in Figure 11, an individual not only observes experiences that re-confirm the contents of a particular sign but they
will encounter other (potentially very different) phenomena which also have
similarity to it. This is, of course, the underlying basis of the kind of metaphorical thinking in which the mind experiences iconicity acting in more playful
ways. Metaphor, it can be suggested, is a side-effect of the mind’s natural inclination to form icons. It has an instinctive tendency to understand the world
through similarities – even when they may not exist in the world.
To conclude this chapter, it is also helpful to consider one final point. Why, in
the ‘received’ view, is it so readily accepted that symbols are formed by social convention? The answer lies, of course, in the fact that the modern view assumes that
only physical objects exist in the world. As such, this position dismisses the suggestion that semiotic activity creates ‘objects of thought’ which possess synthetic

10.3 Peirce on symbols

167

reality. The notion of ‘murder’, therefore, remains always an interpretative ‘construction’ rather than something that is real. It is this self-imposed denial of the
mind’s ability to experience the world through ‘thirdness’ which leads to the semiological conclusion that symbols are conventional. This perspective, inherited
from ‘secondary dualism’, therefore hangs by a thread; the modern reluctance to
accept that ‘objects of thought’ have real existence.

11 Peirce: The third trichotomy
11.1 The third trichotomy and ‘natural propositions’
With the completion of the second trichotomy, a point has been reached in Peirce’s sign classification where a concept has been formed (at least initially), and
yet an actual symbol may (or may not) have been adopted to represent it in
human discourse. The ‘natural history of the sign’ began with the positing of a
hypothetical identity. This accrued indexical inclusions and it has now been
sublated into a ‘third’. This new identity, therefore, contains the indices that
helped form it and which have been determined by the actions of secondness.
The symbol, as a result, is neither an exclusively social, nor personal, construction. Instead, it represents a synthetic identity combining the mental and the experiential in a semiotic ‘amalgam’. As a result, the mind is now armed with a
concept to understand the world and form propositions to describe it. And it is
this latter activity which, for Peirce, takes place in the third trichotomy. It is here
that he moves from an account of concept formation to a consideration of how
signs are employed in human discourse. As such, one of the main tasks of this
essay has now been addressed. But it is still useful to consider how concepts are
used within the third trichotomy (e.g., the second dimension outlined in Figure 1).
As Bergman highlights (2015: 469), “Peirce defines speculative rhetoric as ‘the
study of the necessary conditions of the transmission of meaning from mind to
mind, and from one state of mind to another’”.
In this context, communication is the central focus of the third trichotomy;
here signs are used to convey information. This is, quite naturally, a trichotomy
that interests semioticians with a linguistic background and it is unsurprising
that Peirce is often cited in semiotic communication theory. But, as noted
above, this should not draw attention away from the other role of signs – their
role in concept formation.
Another feature of Peirce’s analysis should also be emphasised. Until this
point, he has been solely concerned with how ‘objects of thought’ are created,
and how they are transformed into symbols. But even when such conceptual
apparatus has been assembled, the intellect is still unable to think in terms of
the contingent relationships which exist between objects. For example, the ‘object of thought’ of a ‘cat’ may have been formed, and this may mean that we
know the kinds of things that cats do. But that does not follow that a proposition can be constructed stating that there is a cat sitting on a mat right now.
This, again, is the task of the third trichotomy; to construct propositions using
the concepts formed in the second trichotomy.

11.1 The third trichotomy and ‘natural propositions’

169

Beginning with the first element of the third trichotomy, Peirce defines the
‘rheme’ as a ‘term’. This is a symbol (EP2: 285) which is now reduced to the status
of a ‘first’. This happens because a symbol is now being used in communication,
and in this discursive context, it will be indeterminate for other people; it may, as
a result, have any number of meanings for a potential listener or reader. This explains the role of conversation for Peirce. It is through human discourse that individuals encounter the indexical inclusions in other people’s symbols.
Because the rheme is a ‘first’ it conveys little information. However, it can be
placed, potentially, within a proposition (EP2: 285). This echoes the role of the
qualisign which, as noted, is not yet ‘embodied’ in a sinsign. Peirce thus maintains that “a Rheme is a sign which, for its Interpretant, is a sign of qualitative
possibility, that is, is understood as representing such and such a kind of possible
Object. Any rheme, perhaps, will afford some information; but it is not interpreted
as doing so” (EP2: 292). Nöth also describes the rheme as follows: “Rhemes, being
single words in isolation, do not convey any information. It is logically impossible
for a rhematic sign to be also informative” (Nöth 2014b: 16). Importantly, however, in the light of previous analysis, a rheme is not an arbitrary ‘word’. It is term
which includes (for its user) an ‘object of thought’ and its indexical associations.
As such, it potentially contains connections with the world capable of being actualised in a proposition.
At the next stage in this trichotomy, the dicisign (or dicent sign), involves
the formation of propositions – making it possible to make assertions about the
world. A proposition makes a claim which describes a particular state of affairs – such as “there is a cat on the mat”. In analysing the nature of the dicisign
it is important to understand its structure and how it makes such assertions.
How this is achieved is debated by Stjernfelt (2014) and Bellucci (2017). Whilst
not being central to this essay, this issue is still of relevance because the above
account of concept formation impacts on the structure of the dicisign.
A proposition makes a statement about the world. In conventional accounts,
a proposition seeks to correspond to a particular state of affairs. This way of construing the proposition, therefore, entails a tacit acceptance of Cartesian dualism.
But Peirce proposes a different view of the proposition which is consistent with
his account of concept formation. Because concepts (as symbols) are, themselves,
already fashioned through secondness, this means that, in a proposition, terms
(rhemes) already contain potential empirical entailments. As a result, a coherent
propositional structure can exist – even if no one actually asserts it. Peirce suggests, for example, that “to fix our ideas, let us set down the proposition ‘Tully
has a wart on his nose’. That is a proposition, whether it be true or not, whether
anybody asserts it or not, and whether anybody assents to it or not” (EP2: 278).
Propositional structures operate, therefore, through the relationships of their

170

11 Peirce: The third trichotomy

component parts. They bring two ‘objects of thought’ together and assert that a
connection may exist between them. It is this structure that creates a proposition –
not the empirical question of whether it is true, or not. Indeed, this philosophical
position has been noted before in Peirce – when he claimed that ‘perceptual judgments’ still possess a propositional structure even if they are false.
Peirce’s example of Tully is, in some ways, an unfortunate one – because it
involves a specific individual. The point Peirce is making becomes a little clearer
with the example of the cat on its mat. There is a difference between:
A. Cats sit on mats
B. A cat is sitting on the mat.
In the first line, (A) is true by virtue of the contents of the ‘object of thought’. The
suggestion that “cats sit on mats” uses an ‘object of thought’ of ‘cat’ (which, in
itself, entails the idea of ‘sitting on mats’ because this is an index which is observed in cats). Importantly for our later discussions, it follows that (A) is an analytic statement by virtue of the terms that it employs.
But proposition (B) is quite different. The latter makes an additional claim
that a particular cat is sitting on a particular mat right now. How does Peirce
deal with this claim regarding a specific situation? His answer derives from the
position of the dicent sign in his sign classification. It is positioned at the point
where the category of secondness is involved; the dicent sign makes a momentary indexical connection between the world and the interpretant it creates.
Peirce (EP2: 278), for example, states that:
Now in performing either of these acts [assertion and assent], the proposition is recognised as being a proposition whether the act be performed or not. Nor can a sound objection be grounded on the fact that a proposition is always understood as something that
might be assented to and asserted. For our definition of the Dicisign more than recognises
the truth that in stating that (supposing the proposition to be a Dicisign) the Interpretant
of it (that is, the mental representation, or thought, which it tends to determine) represents the proposition to be a genuine Index of a real Object, independent of the representation. For an Index involves the existence of its Object. The definition adds that this
Object is a Secondness, or real Fact.

In otherwords, a proposition contains an index because of its position in the
third trichotomy. As a result, it can make a claim about the empirical world. This
assertion, however, is only momentary in nature. It does not provide any rational
underpinning for that belief. This further step only becomes possible when Peirce’s analysis moves on to the ‘argument’.
Stjernfelt highlights Peirce’s discussion of dicisigns (Stjernfelt 2014: 55) in
the 1903 ‘Syllabus’ (EP2: 267–288). He observes that the dicisign consists of two

11.1 The third trichotomy and ‘natural propositions’

171

parts – an iconic and an indexical element. The iconic side of the dicisign provides
an account of what the world is like (a quality established through iconicity),
whilst the indexical element of the dicisign provides a reference in the world. For
Stjernfelt, however, the iconic element acts as a predicate. He states (using examples which are, in many instances, hypoicons), that “photographs, paintings,
moving pictures, diagrams, graphs, algebras, gestures, object samples – in short,
all possible description devices may enter into a dicisign to perform the functional task of predicative iconicity in the Dicisign” (Stjernfelt 2014: 62). But in our
previous analysis, it was emphasised that icons do much more than convey predicates – they enable the mind to form ‘objects of thought’. It follows that, in any
proposition, an icon must always be involved because it has initiated the emergence of the ‘object of thought’. As a result, Stjernfelt misplaces the role of icon.
Through the creation of ‘objects of thought’, icons are involved in the formation of
the subjects of propositions. They do not simply reflect the predicates they contain.
However, this combination of iconic and indexical elements in the dicisign
means that Stjernfelt can assert that propositions are not, as they are in the
nominalist tradition, simply subjective constructions formed using arbitrary
words. Instead, dicisigns constitute ‘natural propositions’ – the title of his 2014
work (Stjernfelt 2014). Such a conclusion suggests important convergences with
the main arguments of this essay. As Stjernfelt claims (Stjernfelt 2014: 105):
A most remarkable implication of a Peircean notion of Dicisigns is the possible naturalization of propositions. Propositions are taken to function without the intermediary of language or consciousness, and propositions are taken to exist before the existence of
human beings – in short, the expression of propositions seem to be natural inhabitants of
any system or process of signs imaginable.

Stjernfelt’s radical claims about the dicisign are, therefore, valid, but he tends
to underplay why a dicisign can operate in this manner. For Stjernfelt, a dicisign indicates a particular state of affairs (often in a diagram) and it combines
this with an indexical assertion that this is the case. But Stjernfelt does not
fully grasp why this is possible. This is, in part, the result of his focus on diagrams, but it is also due to his reticence regarding the earlier, and formational,
dimension of ‘speculative grammar’. For it is the previous ‘natural history of the
sign’ which means that ‘natural propositions’ can be formed. They contain both
iconic and indexical elements (because they employ symbols) and it is this factor
which gives them their synthetic status. And, indeed, it is this aspect of Peirce’s
semiotics which underpins his claim that reality is a matter of “concrete reasonableness” (CP5: 3).
Stjernfelt’s emphasis on the dicisign is also manifested in his analysis of its
potential role in biosemiotics. He argues that dicisigns are the most important

172

11 Peirce: The third trichotomy

signs because they are ‘truth-bearing’. Other signs are seemingly less important
because they are ‘degenerate’ (Stjernfelt 2014: 141):
The ‘highest’ Peircean sign types: propositions and their linking into arguments, are what
represents aspects of reality (propositions) and give rise to inference to action (arguments) –
they must be present from the very beginning of biosemiotics, albeit in a rudimentary indistinct proto-form, corresponding to Peirce’s idea that propositions are genuine signs, and
the whole periodic table of simpler signs are but degenerate signs which naturally occur
within propositions. Selection forces the survival of truth-bearing signs – Dicisigns.

As Cobley (2019: 64), points out this position seems to challenge the ‘common
sense’ view that simpler sign types must exist before more complex ones develop. But our analysis of how symbols evolve (in the second trichotomy) can
now reframe Stjernfelt’s view. If the symbols employed in dicisigns evolve from
combinations of iconic and indexical elements, then these building blocks of
knowledge will have been present in the earlier stages in biological evolution.
Organisms will have been able to form icons and their indexical associations
long before they were able to form sublated symbols (and, as a result, create dicisigns). It is likely, as a result, that animals could have achieved relatively high
levels of cognition, using icons and indices, without the requirement to create
‘genuine’ signs. They would not have needed to have formed dicisigns in the
third trichotomy.
Returning to the final part of Peirce’s sign classification, his last sign type is
the ‘argument’. This sign type combines propositions. It enables the intellect to
create coherent systems of thought which not only describe the world, but also
provide it with reasons for describing it in those terms. In the case of dicisigns, it
was observed that a proposition can only make a momentary assertion about the
world; it cannot provide reasons why it might be valid. In his discussion of dicisigns, Peirce makes this clear (EP2: 275):
The readiest characteristic test showing whether a sign is a Dicisign or not, is that a Dicisign is either true or false, but does not directly furnish reasons for its being so. This
shows that a Dicisign must profess to refer or relate to something as having a real being
independently of the representation of it as such, and further that this reference or relation must not be shown as rational, but must appear as a blind Secondness.

An argument, therefore, places a proposition in a system, or web, of supporting
reasons. A proposition connects two ‘objects of thought’, but it cannot “furnish
reasons for its being so”. The argument, however, is the sign type that achieves
this; it creates a system of thought enabling an understanding of why something might be the case (EP2: 292):

11.1 The third trichotomy and ‘natural propositions’

173

An Argument is a sign which, for its Interpretant, is a sign of a law. Or we may say that a
Rheme is a sign which is understood to represent its Object in its characters merely; that
a Dicisign is a sign which is understood to represent its Object in respect to actual existence; and that an Argument is a sign which is understood to represent its Object in its
character as a sign.

In many ways, therefore, Peirce’s system of interrelating arguments parallels Hegel’s notion of the ‘Absolute Idea’ (Hegel 2014: 229). This concept has plagued
Hegel’s philosophical legacy because of its many metaphysical connotations. But
his system of interconnected concepts, containing an “absolute unity of the notion and objectivity” (Hegel 2014: 229), is precisely what Peirce invokes with his
final sign type. Indeed, Peirce alludes to Hegel when describing his connected
system of signs as follows “a sign is connected with the ‘Truth’, i.e., the entire
Universe of being, or, as some would say, the Absolute . . . .” (EP2: 303). Peirce,
therefore, proposes a system of interrelated signs which, as arguments, are mutually supportive of each other. It is a perspective which suggests that the human
mind develops a sense of harmony amongst its concepts.
This depiction of the universe, as an evolving harmony, can also be found in
Peirce’s view (CP6: 302) that human understanding tends towards ‘agapism’. He
sees this stage in the development of human knowledge as following the two earlier stages of ‘tychism’ and ‘anancasticism’. This framework, again, has strong
Hegelian overtones and suggests that human knowledge has fundamentally progressive characteristics. In the educational sphere, Olteanu argues that this Peircean notion of an emerging harmony in human understanding can also be
applied to educational theory (Olteanu 2015: 211):
The purpose of education is much more than serving the mere functionality of society;
the purpose of learning and education is research (pursuit of Truth). Therefore, the Tychism-Anancasticism-Agapism cosmological evolution applied to learning reveals the
Learning-Education-Research evolution of the role we play in the Universe’s revelation of
itself. Thus, Peirce teaches that research is the Law of Love: ‘The movement of love is circular, at one and the same impulse projecting creations into independency and drawing
them into harmony’ (CP6: 288).

This agapist vision of an evolving ‘harmony’ in human knowledge also derives
from Leibniz. An earlier version of it was noted when his portrayal of the universe as a web of interrelating monads was discussed. Each monad, for Leibniz,
is defined by the sum of its relationships with others and he viewed this system
as being in harmony with God. In the pursuit of higher knowledge, Leibniz argued that if the human mind could only form its concepts with enough precision
(e.g., enough ‘distinctiveness’), it would eventually attain a level of knowledge
comprising ‘real definitions’. And, because these concepts would be relationally

174

11 Peirce: The third trichotomy

defined, they would mutually reflect each other. Leibniz gave a name to this
inter-relating web of monads; he called it a system of ‘pre-established harmony’
(Leibniz [1705] 1951: 586–592). It is this system of conceptual harmony that Hegel
is seeking to re-establish, a century later, when he asserts (Hegel 2014: 149):
Existence is the immediate unity of reflection-into-self and reflection-into-another. It follows from this that existence is the indefinite multitude of existents as reflected-intothemselves, which at the same time equally throw light upon one another, – which, in
short, are co-relative, and form a world of reciprocal dependence and of infinite interconnection between grounds and consequents.

And it is this harmonious unity of knowledge which is echoed by Peirce in his
‘agapism’. It is founded upon the last sign type in the third trichotomy – the
argument.

11.2 Redefining biosemiotic meaning making
Having considered Peirce’s three trichotomies, it is now possible to return to our
earlier discussion of biosemiotics. It was noted that the discipline claims, quite
correctly, to have a heritage in Peircean sign theory because his signs operate
beyond the relatively limited scope of language and culture. But it was also suggested that biosemiotics displays certain constructivist and phenomenological
characteristics which may sit uncomfortably with Peirce who rejects the notion
of ‘interpretation’ as a fundamental feature of semiotic meaning making.
In this context, it is useful to revisit some of the key aspects of biosemiotic
theory and reconsider them in the light of our recent discussions. Specifically, it
is beneficial to re-appraise the biosemiotic notions of the Umwelt and the ‘lower
semiotic threshold’. If the Hegelian influences on Peirce are fully acknowledged,
how does this inform understanding of these two issues?
In a passage from Barbieri, quoted earlier, he identified that there are two
main traditions of meaning making within biosemiotic theory. One of these he
defined as ‘interpretative’ (and, he claims, Peircean) and the other he saw as
founded on ‘code biology’ (Barbieri 2009). But it is now possible to identify a
third way in which meaning is created and which follows a Hegelian template.
This involves the organism creating an Umwelt through the activity of positing an
‘object of thought’ and then refining it through indexical connections. These
emergent semiotic identities have meaning, and they are formed neither through
interpretation, nor through codes. Peirce can thus avoid the phenomenological
and constructivist tendencies sometimes evident in biosemiotics. Moreover, these

11.2 Redefining biosemiotic meaning making

175

emergent identities are formed by individual organisms themselves. They do not
depend on an animal being able to ‘decode’ species-specific signs.
This new way of understanding meaning making creates considerable opportunities for the biosemiotic discipline. In many biosemiotic theories, the Umwelt is constructed using sensory inputs provided by the physical world and it
remains relative to these inputs. In this approach, as discussed above, a degree of
dualism is still likely to be retained. But if a more Hegelian construal of Peirce is
adopted the Umwelt is no longer so constrained. For the universe is no longer the
semiotic outcome of species-specific interpretations of certain experiences; rather,
the very physicality of the universe, itself, is now established in the Umwelt
through the interaction of the organism (as it forms icons) and reality (through secondness). The resulting signs are not interpretations; they are mediating synthetic
creations involving the mind and reality. It follows that any potential division (or
relativity) that may exist between physical reality and the Umwelt is abolished.
The latter is now reframed as the world itself rather than an interpretative construction placed upon it by the organism. As such, a more far-reaching account of
the Umwelt can be suggested for the biosemiotic discipline. In the human sphere,
for example, even the molecules, electrons and atoms of the physical sciences are
emergent ‘objects of thought’. Through scientific experimentation, these putative
identities garner indexical linkages, become ‘thirds’, and have become embedded
in physical laws.
This analysis of Peircean meaning making also has implications for the biosemiotic debate on the lower and upper ‘semiotic thresholds’ (Eco 1976: 19–21). In
particular, the idea of a lower semiotic threshold has been a contentious issue for
biosemioticians (Rodríguez Higuera 2019) for it questions the extent to which the
plant and animal kingdoms construe their own worlds. As noted earlier, Hoffmeyer
asserts, stretching the notion of interpretation to almost breaking point, that even
cells ‘interpret’ their environment (Hoffmeyer 1996: 95). In line with this, Stjernfelt
(2014: 145) suggests that E coli can ‘read’ the presence of sugar:
Thus, when the E. coli reads the perimeter of the carbohydrate molecule, its subsequent
orientated swimming counts as the behavioural proof that a Dicisign combining the abstract shape of the active site with a here-and-now presence of such a site has been processed by the bacterium.

Such positions, however, equate sign formation with the idea of interpretation
and suggest that cells perform anthropomorphic activities. But if a more Hegelian account of Peirce is adopted, then the questions of whether such a threshold
exists, and where it should be placed, are easier to address. Peirce would have
argued that a lower semiotic threshold does exist, but he would have maintained
that it is not established by interpretation. Instead, he would have argued that it

176

11 Peirce: The third trichotomy

is determined by the capacity of an organism to posit an ‘object of thought’. It is
this specific semiotic ability that initiates meaning making. Importantly, Peirce
would also have observed that this activity is distinct from an ability to produce
‘perceptual judgments. On this basis, and extending our discussion in section 5.3,
it is possible to distinguish three kinds of cognitive interaction with the world:
1. Basic Sensations – the purely physical effects of light, heat etc impacting
on the sense receptors of an organism (with no ‘interpretation’, or sign formation, has taken place). This is the level of Peircean percepts and ‘firstness’
where no specific identity has been given to a sensation. As Alva Noë observes, “to perceive is not merely to have sensory stimulation. It is to have
sensory stimulation which one understands” (Noë 2004: 181). ‘Basic sensations’ are thus sensory stimulations without such understanding.
2. Perceptual Judgments – in which an organism experiences something as
something. This involves recognition that a particular sense datum is similar to others, and it is the member of a potential class.
3. Sign Formation – whereby an organism experiences something as something else (through the activity of positing of an ‘object of thought’ which, as
a potential new identity, can later evolve into a ‘genuine sign’).44
Holding these three distinctions in view, it is possible to demarcate a potential
division between ‘perceptual judgments’ and the activity of sign formation itself
(e.g., between levels two and three). For these two cognitive activities, previously
grouped together under the general heading of ‘interpretation’, can now be distinguished from each other. Returning to Stjernfelt’s example, it is possible, for
example, to reappraise the E. coli swimming towards the sugar. The bacterium
can sense the sugar as a source of food, (e.g., as a ‘perceptual judgement’) rather
than the beginnings of sign formation (3). The sugar is simply something ‘positive’ that the E. coli recognises and wants to get closer to. In the plant kingdom,
flowers, likewise, turn towards the sunlight as a source of energy. But what is
highly unlikely is that either the E. coli, or the flowers, are capable of positing

44 This construal of signhood differs from that of Eco. He insists that a key characteristic of
the sign is its ability to ‘stand for something else’, but the way in which Eco defines this is in
entirely cultural terms. He states in ‘A Theory of Semiotics’ (Eco 1976: 16): ‘I propose to define
as a sign everything that, on the grounds of a previously established social convention, can be
taken as something standing for something else’. So, Eco, whilst agreeing with Peirce that signs
‘stand for something else’ retains his social perspective contra the more cognitive and individualistic stance of Peirce. At the heart of the matter is a fundamental difference on what ‘stands
for’ means. For Eco, it involves an interpretation being imposed on a sense datum; for Peirce,
in contrast, it means that an interpretant translates a representamen through sublation.

11.2 Redefining biosemiotic meaning making

177

(e.g., hypothesising) an ‘object of thought’. In contrast, many ‘higher’ organisms
can do this. For example, a swan will approach a person on a riverbank because
it sees them as a source of bread. The swan can form an ‘object of thought’; the
individual on the bank is the kind of being (e.g., an icon) which often carries
bread (an index) and so the person on the riverbank becomes a sign of food. This
is different to the scenario with the E. coli. For the swan does not directly perceive
the bread in the way that the E. coli perceives the sugar. In the case of the swan,
the person ‘stands for something else’ and is thus a sign of bread. This is meaning
making in the true semiotic sense.
This revised analysis also has consequences for the ‘upper semiotic threshold’. This is defined by Eco in terms of interpretation. He argues that when semioticians think about objects in purely physical (e.g., non-semiotic) terms, they
should no longer be treated as cultural objects because they are beyond interpretation. A ‘space’ is, therefore, hypothesised by Eco in between the two thresholds.
This is where interpretation is thought to operate – above the point where it becomes intellectually possible and below the point where interpretation is replaced
by ‘hard’ facts. As Nöth points out (Nöth 2000: 50):
Possible non-semiotic perspectives from which our cultural objects can then be considered
are thus the physical, the mechanical, the economic, and the social perspectives, and
these, according to Eco, are the perspectives from beyond the upper semiotic threshold.

But these demarcations can be challenged in the context of Peircean sign formation. If the intellect’s understanding of the physical world itself begins with posited ‘objects of thought’, which become symbols and the components of physical
laws, then it follows that even the physical world itself falls within the realm of
biosemiotics. The ‘upper semiotic threshold’ is thus effectively abolished. The
discipline is no longer confined to the limited remit of human, or animal, interpretation. Its scope extends to the entirety of the synthetic universe. Peirce states
that humans are in a universe made up of signs and that we are “immersed in
signs” (CP5: 289). This is the direct result of the intellect’s ability to create a synthetic world of signs – not from its ability to interpret the physical world. Arran
Gare suggests that “biosemiotics is at the centre of this struggle to overcome Cartesian Dualism and to overcome the rift between science and the humanities”
(Gare 2019: 90). Abolishing the ‘upper semiotic threshold’ represents a major
step in this direction.
In conclusion, and in line with the tenets of biosemiotic theory, organisms
do, indeed, form their own Umwelt. But this concept can now be established on a
revised basis: an organism’s ability to posit ‘objects of thought’. This is different
from the view that organisms belong to a particular species and have, as a result,
access to species-specific ‘codes’, or the suggestion that they interpret their

178

11 Peirce: The third trichotomy

environment. In contrast, Peirce offers a new way of establishing the Umwelt
which provides a revised platform for the ‘lower semiotic threshold’. Moreover,
this revised Peircean account also challenges Eco’s claims regarding the existence
of an upper semiotic threshold. There is no physical world of ‘hard facts’ outside
of semiotics because the entire universe (including its physicality) consists of mediating signs.45

45 Pattee argues that the problem of dualism is implicit in any discussion of the interface between physics and biology. He argues that “the problem is that any concept of subject or self
implies the existence of an object or non-self. For physics the relation of subject to object has
always been the fundamental problem” (Pattee 2015: 460–467). In this context, he suggests
that dualism can be reframed as a distinction between symbols and matter which is determined by what he calls the ‘epistemic cut’ (Pattee 2001: 5–21). He argues that the belief that
there are such things as isolated objective ‘facts’ rests on the erroneous belief that, when a
phenomenon is measured, it is possible to isolate the act of measuring from the phenomenon
itself. Pattee rightly claims this is not possible. For example, an attempt to measure a temperature, will always involve the physical effects of the measuring devices used (Pattee 2015:
460–467).
The problem of the ‘epistemic cut’ derives, of course, from the model of ‘secondary dualism’. It is only by assuming that the identity of a particular sense datum is known that the
physical sciences can make a claim that it is an isolated ‘hard’ fact. Pattee agrees with Peirce
that it is not possible to do this – everything is connected in experience. Pattee’s discussion of
temperature measurement, therefore, illustrates Peirce’s point that ‘objects of thought’ are relationally connected. Pattee also argues that symbols can overcome the ‘epistemic cut’ because their separation from matter is an illusion (Pattee 2001: 5–21). This, again, is broadly
correct. But his interpretation of symbols is still some distance from Peirce. Pattee still claims
that symbols are formed through interpretation and codes. He states that “symbols exist only
in the context of codes and interpreters” (Pattee 2007: 11). This terminology does not reflect
Peirce’s claim that symbols are mediating, and synthetic, ‘objects of thought’.

12 Vygotsky on concept formation
In previous chapters, our discussion has focused on Peirce’s account of sign formation as it is influenced by Hegelian philosophy. It has been suggested that
Peirce construes his own ‘natural history of the sign’ as a succession of sign types
combining with each other to form a genuine sign (a ‘third’). This semiotic evolution is determined by his three categories interacting with the three elements of
the sign. Peirce thus outlines how putative identities are initially formed by the
mind, how they develop their indexical links, and how they are finally sublated
into symbols. In the third trichotomy, these symbols (now in the form of rhemes)
are used to create propositions and arguments to describe the world.
Vygotsky’s own account of concept formation is, in many respects, much
simpler than that of Peirce. He does not seek to establish an account of how the
mind achieves synthetic knowledge at an epistemological level; as a psychologist,
he simply wants to explain how children develop their own concepts. As a result,
the scope of Vygotsky’s work is somewhat narrower than Peirce’s. But, as observed
earlier, it is relatively easy to view Vygotsky’s work through a twentieth century
lens which privileges social constructivist ways of thinking and underplays its Hegelian aspects. One of the purposes of this chapter is to further illustrate how Hegelian influences also run through Vygotskian thought and bring them to the fore.
In chapters three and seven, consideration was given to Vygotsky’s accounts of
perception, dialecticism, and mediation and it was suggested that these should
considered in a more Hegelian context. In this current chapter, the Vygotskian
stages of concept formation, itself, are detailed. This analysis will reveal further
convergences between Vygotsky and Peirce which will confirm their shared heritage in Hegel and will also draw Peirce into the mainstream of educational learning theory where Vygotsky is so well established.

12.1 The ‘natural history of the sign’
Vygotsky describes the process of concept formation as a “natural history of the
sign” (Vygotsky 1978: 46). Following Hegel, he believes that concepts evolve
through a series of qualitative transformations. These create, as Linask observes,
“one single line of ontogeny” (Linask 2019: 300). Vygotsky argues, however, that
there are several distinct stages in this process, and it is important to evaluate
how these determine a child’s concepts. As already noted, the mediating entities
created through this activity are the units of analysis which Vygotsky calls ‘word

https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110695854-013

180

12 Vygotsky on concept formation

meanings’. They are formed by two ‘lines of development’ combining with each
other (Vygotsky 1978: 46):
Within a general process of development, two qualitatively different lines of development,
differing in origin, can be distinguished: the elementary processes, which are of biological origin, on the one hand, and higher psychological functions, of sociocultural origin,
on the other. The history of child behaviour is born from the interweaving of these two lines.
The history of the development of the higher psychological functions is impossible without a study of their prehistory, their biological roots, and their organic disposition.

Vygotsky emphasises that these ‘lines of development’ exist alongside each
other; one never dominates the other. In otherwords, ‘word meanings’ never entirely replace natural ‘spontaneous concepts’; rather they emerge from them. Vygotsky confirms this when he states that (Vygotsky 1994: 163):
Further, we believe that psychological analysis, penetrating beyond the external manifestation of phenomena and revealing the inner structure of psychological processes and,
particularly, the analysis of the development of higher forms, compels us to acknowledge
the unity, but not the identity, of higher and lower psychological functions.

It has already been observed that, for Vygotsky, adult ‘words’ help the child
pick out particular identities from the confusion of ‘natural perception’. But
concept formation is not as straightforward as this. In a clear parallel with Hegelian thought, Vygotsky divides this evolutionary activity into “three basic
phases” (Vygotsky 2012: 117) with still smaller stages contained within them.
These three main stages are:
– ‘Unorganised congeries’, or ‘heaps’
– Complexes (of which there are several kinds)
– Concepts
Vygotsky outlines the process of concept formation in several of his writings. In
this analysis, the focus will be mainly on the account given in ‘Thought and
Language’ (Vygotsky: 2012).
In the first phase of concept formation, the child identifies basic groups of
objects (Vygotsky 2012: 117–118):
The young child takes the first step toward concept formation when he puts together a
number of objects in an unorganised congeries, or ‘heap’, in order to solve a problem that
we adults would normally solve by forming a new concept. The heap, consisting of disparate objects grouped together without any basis, reveals a diffuse, undirected extension of
the meaning of the sign (artificial word) to inherently unrelated objects linked by chance in
the child’s perception. At that stage, word meaning denotes nothing more to the child than

12.1 The ‘natural history of the sign’

181

a vague syncretic conglomeration of individual objects that have somehow or other coalesced
into an image in his mind. Because of its syncretic origin, that image is highly unstable.

This passage echoes the Hegelian description of undifferentiated ‘Being’. There is
no rational organisation in the way that the child groups objects, because only
‘natural perception’ is involved. The language that Vygotsky employs here is also
rich in Peircean parallels; Vygotsky’s “heaps” equate to Peircean ‘vagues’. Indeed, Peirce, himself, even uses the terminology of “non-relative congeries” at
one point in his writings (CP5: 493). In addition, Vygotsky’s terminology, when
he describes “a vague syncretic conglomeration of individual objects”, reflects
Peirce’s synechism.
The second stage of Vygotskian concept formation is more complicated and
involves what he calls ‘complexes’. He makes several sub-divisions within this
second stage which reflect the ways in which a complex may correlate with reality. Vygotsky maintains that “in a complex, individual objects are united in the
child’s mind not only by his subjective impressions but also by bonds actually
existing between these objects. This is a new achievement, an ascent to a much
higher level” (Vygotsky 2012: 120). These bonds establish potential connections
between objects, but in a ‘complex’ these linkages are not abstracted; they remain firmly rooted in the factual domain. Vygotsky, for example, insists that “in
a complex, the bonds between its components are concrete and factual rather
than abstract and logical, just as we do not classify a person as belonging to the
Petrov family because of any logical relation between him and other bearers of
the name. The question is settled for us by facts” (Vygotsky 2012: 120–121).
Because of the various ways in which a child classifies objects, Vygotsky identifies five ways in which a ‘complex’ can be formed. Although only one of these
types is described as associative, Vygotsky views them all as possessing associative (or contiguous) features (Vygotsky 1994: 219). Interestingly, in these definitions, it is possible to observe a small departure from Hegel. Vygotsky views the
different complexes as being formed by a unification of previously separate elements. To this extent, some level of perceptual ‘atomism’ has crept into Vygotsky’s
account. Objects are being treated as separate entities and are not being viewed as
part of a perceptual continuum requiring further determination. As such, Vygotsky
sees the child building its complexes from a series of atomised entities; he does
not assume, as Hegel and Peirce do, that the child starts with a single experience
of ‘Being’. However, the first four initial complexes are as follows:
– Associative Complexes – based on the weakest of links being established –
“It may be based on any bond the child notices between the sample object
and some other blocks” (Vygotsky 2012: 121).

Collection Complexes – based upon functional links of what goes with what:
“Experience teaches the child certain forms of functional grouping: cup, saucer, and spoon; a place setting of knife, fork, spoon and plate; the set of
clothes he wears” (Vygotsky 2012: 123).
Chain Complexes – “a dynamic, consecutive joining together of individual
links into a single chain, with meaning carried over from one link to the next”
(Vygotsky 2012: 123). This complex type demonstrates a key attribute of complexes – “An object included because of one of its attributes enters the complex not just as the carrier of that one trait but as an individual with all its
attributes” (Vygotsky 2012: 124). This is one of the key differences between
complexes and concepts.
Diffuse Complexes – these are created by the child because they think
that “attributes are sometimes considered similar, not because a genuine
likeness, but because of a dim impression that they have something in common . . . . The diffuse complex is marked by the fluidity of the very attribute
that unites its single elements. Perceptually concrete groups of objects or
images are formed by means of diffuse, indeterminate bonds” (Vygotsky
2012: 125–126).

For Vygotsky, the main characteristic of these complexes is that they are based on
‘association’. In many ways, these ‘complexes’ correspond, therefore, to the indexical stage in Peircean thought as empirical links begin to be created. However, at
this point, another feature of Peirce’s model should be highlighted through its
very absence. There appears, in this Vygotskian account, to be no equivalent of
the Peircean ‘icon’ in his treatment of concept formation; there is no initiating
‘form’ at the beginning of the process. The child is simply making associative connections between objects. This is undoubtedly because these objects are already
viewed, by Vygotsky, as possessing their own identities – even though ‘indeterminacy’ is mentioned in Vygotsky’s account regarding ‘diffuse complexes’.
There is, additionally, a fifth type of complex which Vygotsky calls the
‘pseudoconcept’. This is the final type of ‘complex’ before a genuine concept is
formed. However, the ‘pseudoconcept’ appears, to an outside observer as if it is a
concept. Vygotsky asserts that “we call this type of complex the pseudoconcept
because the generalisation formed in the child’s mind, although phenotypically
resembling the adult concept, is psychologically very different from the concept
proper; in its essence, it is still a complex” (Vygotsky 2012: 127). What makes the
‘pseudoconcept’ appear to be a concept is the fact that a word has now been borrowed from others. The child is able to articulate this received word, but the underlying concept (or ‘word meaning’) has yet to be formed. But it is clear, at this
point, that ‘outer speech’ is now playing a role in concept formation; the child is

12.1 The ‘natural history of the sign’

183

going beyond their own associative classifications. The ‘pseudoconcept’ is differentiated from the other ‘complexes’ as follows (Vygotsky 2012: 129):
Adults, through their verbal communication with the child, are able to predetermine the
path of the development of generalisations and its final point – a fully formed concept.
But the adult cannot pass on to the child his mode of thinking. He merely supplies the
ready-made meanings of the words, around which the child builds complexes. Such complexes are nothing but pseudoconcepts. They are similar to concepts in their appearance,
but differ substantially in their essence.

With the emergence of the ‘pseudoconcept’, however, the developmental process
now introduces the previously missing, and critical, idea of form into Vygotskian
concept formation. It is of note, for example, in the passage above, that a ‘word’ is
now able to “predetermine the path of the development of generalisations”. To
quote Fonseca earlier, the Vygotskian word now ‘structures the knowing power’.
Another key characteristic of the ‘pseudoconcept’ is that abstraction also begins to
take place at this point. A single, or few, aspects of the complex are ‘picked out’
by the child to stand for all the properties of the incipient concept (Vygotsky 2012:
144):
Complex thinking begins the unification of scattered impressions; by organising discrete
elements of experience into groups, it creates a basis for later generalisations. But the advanced concept presupposes more than unification. To form such a concept, it is necessary to abstract, to single out elements, and to view the abstracted elements apart from
the totality of the concrete experience in which they are embedded. In genuine concept
formation, it is equally important to unite and to separate: Synthesis and analysis presuppose each other as inhalation presupposes exhalation.

And this corresponds with Hegel’s insistence that (Hegel 2014: 138):
Or, rather, abstraction is the imposition of this Identity of form, the transformation of
something inherently concrete into this form of elementary simplicity. And this may be
done in two ways. Either we may neglect a part of the multiple features which are found
in the concrete thing (by what is called analysis) and select only one of them; or, neglecting their variety, we may concentrate the multiple features into one.

However, the activity of abstraction (“the imposition of this identity of form”) is
still fraught with potential difficulties for the child. Inevitably, he or she will
not always make correct ‘choices’ when choosing which defining features to
adopt. This means that the ‘pseudoconcept’ is like a Hegelian Essence; it is inherently unstable, and it contains contradictions (Vygotsky 1994: 229):
So, our analysis led us to the conclusion that an internal contradiction is present in the
pseudoconcept, the most widespread concrete form of thinking in complexes in children,
which is imprinted on its very name and which, on the one hand, is the greatest problem

184

12 Vygotsky on concept formation

and obstacle we face in our attempts to investigate it from the scientific point of view,
and on the other, underlines its enormous functional and genetic significance as the most
important determining factor in the process of development of thinking in children.

This explains why Vygotsky still views the ‘pseudoconcept’ as simply a steppingstone towards a child’s potential concepts (Vygotsky 2012: 148):
But as long as complex thinking predominates, the abstracted trait is unstable, has no
privileged position, and easily yields its temporary dominance other traits. In potential
concepts proper, a trait once abstracted is not easily lost again among the other traits.
The concrete totality of traits has been destroyed through its abstraction, and the possibility of unifying the traits on a different basis opens up. Only the mastery of abstraction,
combined with advanced complex thinking enables the child to progress to the formation
of genuine concepts.

However, the most important aspect of the ‘pseudoconcept’ is that the child is
using the word of an adult, or peer, in concept formation. As a result, the ‘pseudoconcept’ represents an important bridge between the ‘complex’ and the concept. It marks the point where a ‘word meaning’ begins to be formed.
Vygotsky is recognised, by almost all commentators, as emphasising the
social dimension in concept formation. As noted earlier, many interpret him as
proposing that meanings are socially constructed and then ‘interiorized’ by the
child. But it is now possible to identify an alternative role for the social dimension. The speech of others provides the child (when confronted with an emerging ‘complex’) with a form for a potential concept. The social dimension, by
providing a ‘word’, thus enables the child to discover a potential pathway for
an emergent concept. In Hegel, and Peirce, the intellect itself performs this
task – by positing a Hegelian Essence, or a Peircean icon. In Vygotsky’s dialectical psychology, in contrast, the ‘words’ of other people provide these critical
forms. It is evident, therefore, that whilst the social dimension does provide an
essential ingredient for Vygotsky, it does not deliver fully formed concepts, in
toto. As noted earlier, Bruner raises the issue of ‘interiorization’ for Vygotsky,
but a solution is now possible. Commentators are mistaken if they assume that
Vygotsky’s emphasis on the ‘word’ suggests that complete concepts are given
to a child through language. Instead, the role of the social dimension is narrower and more specific – to provide a potential form for the emerging concept.
Of course, it could be suggested that this argument amounts to hair-splitting.
If the key element required for the concept comes from the social dimension,
doesn’t this mean that concepts are social, after all? However, the fact that one
element of the concept (the ‘form’) stems from ‘outer speech’ does not mean that
concepts are, themselves, created within the social sphere. But commentators,
such as Bakhurst, still conclude that “it is an enduring theme of Vygotsky’s

12.1 The ‘natural history of the sign’

185

writings that the higher mental functions are social in origin. Their development
cannot be portrayed as the outcome of biological maturation, but essentially involves the child’s appropriation of culture” (Bakhurst 2011: 153). It is precisely this
view that the child is involved in an “appropriation of culture” that is misguided
here. Just because the social dimension represents a reservoir of forms, this does
not mean that a child appropriates a culture in toto. All that Vygotsky is suggesting is that culture represents a repository of potential pathways for the child’s internal concept formation. There is no need to invoke social ‘activity’, ‘negotiation’,
or ‘participation’ to explain this process.
Vygotsky also argues, quoting Hegel himself, that concept development involves a form of qualitative change (Vygotsky 1997b: 39):
About its quality, we can say, in the words of Hegel, that something is what it is because
of its quality, and losing its quality, it ceases being what it is, for the development of behaviour from animal to man resulted in the appearance of a new quality. This is our main
idea. This development is not exhausted by a simple increased complexity of those relations between stimuli and responses which were already presented to us in animal psychology. Neither does it proceed along the path of quantitative increase and branching of
these relations. At its centre is a dialectical leap that leads to a qualitative change in the
relation between the stimulus and the response.

This passage corresponds to Hegel’s discussion of the relationship between
quality and quantity in the ‘Science of Logic’ (Hegel 2014: 100–123). And Vygotsky’s mention of a ‘dialectical leap’ clearly references Hegel’s notion of ‘sublation’. Earlier, it was noted that the Peircean interpretant involves the creation of
a new identity in a similar way; it establishes a new identity which stands for
something other than itself. Vygotsky reflects this same convergence with Hegel
when he states, “but in this highest form of behaviour the habits which participate in an intellectual operation and form part of the structure have already become a ‘superseded category’” (Vygotsky 1997a: 188).
In addition to this, the Vygotskian concept displays other characteristics
which are now familiar to our discussion. In Peircean semiotics, when an ‘object
of thought is posited, the mind raises the saliency of some of its perceptual elements and reduces those of others. For Vygotsky, when a concept starts to be
formed, the child likewise moves beyond ‘natural perception’ and creates something new (Vygotsky: 2012: 145):
Still, the global character of the child’s perception has been breached. An object’s attributes have been divided into two parts unequally attended to – a beginning of positive
and negative abstraction. An object no longer enters a complex in toto, with all its attributes – some are denied admission; if the object is impoverished thereby, the attributes
that caused its inclusion in the complex acquire a sharper relief in the child’s thinking.

186

12 Vygotsky on concept formation

However, as with Hegel, Vygotsky is careful to emphasise what this involves. He
does not adopt a Lockean account of abstraction whereby the mind identifies certain similarities and forms a general term on that basis. Instead, abstraction, for
Vygotsky, involves the interaction of the two lines of thought. In the translation
of ‘Thought and Language’ in ‘The Collected Works of Vygotsky’, Vygotsky describes this process as follows (and note his mention of a mediating “middle
level concept”) (Vygotsky 1987: 162):
On the contrary, the child uses the most general concepts from the very beginning. He
reaches the middle level concept not though abstraction, not by moving from below to
above, but through definitions, by moving from higher to lower. The child’s representations move from the undifferentiated, from genus to species and variety.

Interestingly, this more detailed account of abstraction is missing from the Kozulin translation of ‘Thought and Language’ and represents an important omission
because abstraction, for Vygotsky, involves a concept becoming established,
through qualification, in a network of other concepts (Vygotsky 1987: 162):
Rather than involving a simple isolation of similar features from a series of concrete objects,
the process of concept formation came to be understood as a complex process involving the
movement of thinking through the pyramid of concepts, a process involving constant movement from the general to the particular and from the particular to the general.

Within the “pyramid of concepts”, the child can identify what is contained (and
what is not contained) within a particular concept and, in addition, how each
concept may fit within a wider system of other concepts. This reflects the Hegelian description of abstraction discussed earlier. The child establishes which
ideas are more general, more specific, and which are positioned within a pyramid as a subset of others.
Another feature of the concept which Vygotsky highlights is its ‘instrumental’
role. He states that a genuine concept becomes a “main instrument of thought”
(Vygotsky 2012: 148). As such, it parallels the Peircean sign which makes “inefficient relations efficient” (SS: 31). Vygotsky, for example, argues that “on the contrary, the very difference between the complex and the concept lies in the different
functional uses of the word. The word is a sign, and as such it may be used in
different ways depending on what kind of intellectual operation it is involved in”
(Vygotsky 2012: 149). This, of course, also reflects Vygotsky’s contention that signs
are ‘tools’. But no physical manifestation of a tool is involved here. The concept,
itself, is a semiotic ‘instrument’ because it facilitates greater understanding of the
world.
In the development of the Peircean sign, it was observed that symbols contain indexical components. It was also highlighted, however, that, for Vygotsky,

12.1 The ‘natural history of the sign’

187

these indexical associations are present in complexes, before a ‘word’ (or form) is
borrowed from ‘outer speech’. As a result of this, Vygotsky clearly possesses no
equivalent of Peircean secondness and, by emphasising ‘dialectical psychology’,
he follows Hegel more faithfully than Peirce. In this context, Vygotsky tends, instead, to focus on memory as the mechanism which enables a child to include
various ‘indexical’ properties within its concepts. In ‘Mind in Society’, he argues
(Vygotsky 1978: 36):
The possibility of combining elements of the past and present visual fields (for instance,
tool and goal) in one field of attention leads in turn to a basic reconstruction of another
vital function, memory. Through verbal formulations of past situations and activities, the
child frees himself from the limitations of direct recall; he succeeds in synthesizing the
past and the present to suit his purposes. The changes that occur in memory are similar
to those that occur in the child’s perceptual field where centres of gravity are shifted and
figure and ground relationship are altered. The child’s memory not only makes fragments
of the past more available, but also results in a new method of uniting the elements of past
experience with the present. Created with the help of speech, the time field for action extends both forward and backward. Future activity that can be included in an ongoing activity is represented by signs.

In the emerging concept, therefore, Vygotsky insists that experiences in memory become included within a ‘word meaning’ and their ‘indexical’ inclusions
stretch forwards and backwards.46 These elements form the indexical contents
of a concept and the connections between concepts. Vygotsky states, in a formulation which could have been written by Peirce himself, that “a real concept is an
image of an objective thing in all its complexity. Only when we recognise the
thing in all its connections and relations, only when this diversity is synthesised
in a word, in an integral image through a multitude of determinations, do we develop a concept” (Vygotsky 1998: 53).
Because the Vygotskian concept is not taken, in toto, from adults, an important effect of this is that a child’s newly formed concept will always be different,
in key respects, from the adult concept. There will always, as a result, be a ‘gap’
between the child’s new concept and the received ‘word’. This is because the personal experiences (e.g., ‘natural perceptions’) that a child uses in concept formation will always be different from those of the adult. Vygotsky states, for example,
when talking about ‘paths’, that (Vygotsky 1994: 228):
The speech of the people surrounding the child, with its established, constant meanings,
predetermines the path which the development of the child’s generalisations can take. It

46 Vygotsky’s mention of memory as a mechanism providing a child with evidence of the future activity of an object echoes Peirce’s pragmatism. This doctrine asserts that concepts provide knowledge of how objects will behave in the future based on previous experience.

188

12 Vygotsky on concept formation

limits the child’s individual actions and directs them down specific, strictly defined channels. But the child, whilst travelling along this defined predetermined path, continues to
think in ways peculiar to the stage of development of intellect where he happens to be at
that time. By engaging the child in verbal communication, an adult can influence the further progress of this generalisation process, as well as the end and outcome of that journey which will be the result of the child’s generalisations. But adults cannot pass on their
method of thinking to children. A child assimilates ready-made meanings of words from
adults, but he does not have to select actual themes for the complexes himself.

The words of adults and peers, therefore, offer “strictly defined channels” for concept development, but they do not “pass on” pre-formed meanings. The words of
others only provide an indicative ‘pathway’ for concept development.
In this chapter, it has been highlighted that Vygotsky’s ‘natural history of the
sign’ displays certain parallels, and some important differences, when compared
with Peirce. The most notable of these, perhaps, is that Vygotsky does not utilise
an equivalent of the Peircean icon at the initial stage of a concept’s development.
Instead, the notion of ‘form’ only enters, at a later stage, with the ‘word’ of others.
This final stage in concept formation reflects the ‘sublation’ that occurs when, to
use Peirce’s terminology, a ‘third’ is created. The fact that the ‘word’ delivers this
‘form’ gives the social dimension an important role in concept formation, but this
is quite different from that attributed by commentators who wish to enrol Vygotsky in their social constructivist fold.

12.2 The zone of proximal development
Vygotsky’s Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) has attracted much attention in
the literature, and it has informed the notion of ‘scaffolding’ in educational theory.
The various interpretations of the ZPD in the literature have been wide-ranging
and they have been applied to child psychology in several ways. In an educational
context, the focus of commentators has been placed, not surprisingly, on the
ZPD’s potential utility in the classroom – both as a means of conceptualising child
attainment and as a way for thinking about the learning process itself. In this section, however, the ZPD will be considered in a new way; it will be evaluated
through the lens of Peircean sign theory. What role does the Vygotskian ZPD play
in this revised context, and does it have an equivalent in Peircean thought?
Many commentators view the ZPD as a metaphorical ‘space’, or ‘gap’, which
exists between the child’s learning ability, as an individual, and their enhanced
ability with the help of another person (usually a teacher, but also a peer). In Vygotsky’s writings on the ZPD, this position seems to be well supported. For example, Vygotsky (1978: 86) defines the ZPD as:

12.2 The zone of proximal development

189

This difference between twelve and eight, or between nine and eight, is what we call the
zone of proximal development. It is the distance between the actual developmental level as
determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable
peers.

On this basis, the ZPD seems to offer the opportunity to explore how a child’s
underlying potential can be brought to the surface. It is this which has led to
the idea of ‘scaffolding’ (Wood, Bruner, and Ross: 1976), and this, in turn, has
spawned numerous educational studies evaluating how the ZPD enhances the
learning process (an example would be Moll’s use of the ZPD in teaching bilingualism (Moll 2014). Linked to this, there has also been a tendency to interpret
Vygotsky’s mention of “distance” as suggesting that the ZPD can be used to measure a child’s development – as if there were two objective attainment levels contained within it.
But the most important aspect of the ZPD, highlighted in many interpretations, has been, unsurprisingly, its social aspect. In some cases, the Zone of
Proximal Development has even been interpreted as a “zone” in a physical
sense and related to the classroom environment. In these construals, the ZPD
“has to do with the manner in which we arrange the environment such that a
child can reach higher or more abstract ground from which to reflect, ground on
which he is enabled to be more conscious” (Moll 2014: 24). Newman and Holzman, likewise, suggest the “ZPD is not a technique, or an experiment, but a reorganizing of environmental scenes to create new meaning and a learning that
leads development” (Newman and Holzman 1993: 147). Elsewhere, Bruner argues
that the ZPD is, essentially, the learning context created by the teacher. He claims
that “the tutor, in effect, performs the critical function of ‘scaffolding’ the learning task to make it possible for the child, in Vygotsky’s word, to internalize external knowledge and convert it into a tool for conscious control” (Bruner 1985: 25).
Other writers have referenced Vygotsky’s ZPD to highlight the need for
learning ‘partners’ (Gauvin 2001: 35):
According to Vygotsky, higher mental functions have their origins in human social life as
children interact with more experienced members of their community. This process involves a child as an active participant working with a more competent partner to solve a
problem. To facilitate children’s participation and learning, more experienced partners
target their assistance to a child’s zone of proximal development . . .

And Stables suggests that “Vygotsky believed that the cognitive gap between
child and parent, or student and teacher, was a zone of ‘proximal development’
or potential growth, and the quality of interaction across this gap would determine whether the child could reach the next level of mental operations” (Stables

190

12 Vygotsky on concept formation

2008: 107). Other commentators, however, have pointed out that Vygotsky does
not necessarily include current interpersonal activity in the ZPD. Daniels (2016:
64), for example, asserts that the ZPD can operate in the absence of an adult or
peer and some commentators insist that, even if a teacher is not present at the
time, they have been there in the past (in a classroom setting). In this interpretation, the child develops their concepts in the ZPD using previously received help.
In all these construals, the social aspects of the ZPD are placed centre stage and
they, again, reflect social constructivist accounts of concept formation. As Miller
wryly observes, this transforms the ZPD into “a kind of magical learning-teaching
capsule” (Miller 2011: 122).
One of the assumptions of these more social interpretations is that the ZPD
involves communication. And once the ZPD has been construed within a communication model, other problems arise. For it follows, as Bruner noted above,
that advocates of this view must explain how ‘interiorisation’ takes place. It is useful to revisit this issue because it highlights specific misconceptions about the
ZPD.
When discussing concept formation, commentators often note Vygotsky’s
use of the term ‘imitation’. This suggests a form of ‘copying’ that enables a
child to create their own concepts. On occasions, this view does, indeed, seem
to be supported by Vygotsky himself (Vygotsky 2012: 199):
In the child’s development, on the contrary, imitation and instruction play a major role.
They bring out the specifically human qualities of the mind and lead the child to new
developmental levels. In learning to speak, as in learning school subjects, imitation is indispensable. What the child can do in cooperation today he can do alone tomorrow.

But there are difficulties if this passage is taken at face value. Vygotsky is not
claiming that ‘imitation’ is the same as ‘copying’. Miller, for example, notes that
Vygotsky “identifies imitation as the underlying process but points out that a particular kind of imitation is involved that is not based on a blind mechanical kind
of copying” (Miller 2011: 120). So, the question is this: what kind of ‘imitation’ occurs in the ZPD? Miller himself believes that Vygotsky does not resolve this specific
question satisfactorily. Criticising Vygotsky, he concludes that (Miller 2011:153):
But how the human instructional kind of imitation differs from the mechanical copying
kind of imitation and what it consists of or what additional processes are involved in its
operation, as distinct from the outcomes produced, are matters that are not directly addressed. This is not a mere oversight but represents a significant theoretical gap at the
heart of his [Vygotsky’s] account of instruction and development.

Miller’s conclusion, however, overlooks Vygotsky’s adherence to Hegelian dialecticism and the idea of ‘positing’. These Hegelian themes offer a potential

12.2 The zone of proximal development

191

answer to these attacks on Vygotsky. For if the social dimension is viewed, as
proposed above, as a source of potential ‘forms’, then it is possible to entirely
reframe the notion of ‘imitation’. It is evident that “mechanical copying” is not
required in concept formation if all that is transferred to the child is a ‘form’, or
‘pathway’, in the shape of a word. These pathways are, indeed, ‘imitations’ of the
adult concept, but they still remain individual to the child. Newman and Holzman
come very close to this position when they state that “imitation in the ZPD is the
activity of making meaning, where the predetermining tools of the adult language, and the resulting predetermined tools of the mind are used by the child –
the toolmaker – to create something that is not determined by them” (Newman
and Holzman 1993: 87).
And this analysis also has important consequences for the activity of concept
formation over time. If all that is provided by ‘outer speech’ are potential ‘forms’,
then it follows that the child still retains significant control over elements of a particular concept (through their ‘natural perceptions’). And because the experiences
of each individual, or each generation, are very different to each other, it follows
that their concepts will reflect their own empirical experiences. For example, the
concept of ‘communication’ will be very different for a child brought up in the
1970’s compared with a child born in the twenty-first century.
Vygotsky’s treatment of the ZPD also suggests that the notion has important
applications beyond the learning environment. These additional uses of the concept further undermine the argument that the word ‘zone’ should be taken literally. In particular, Vygotsky highlights the ZPD in relation to ‘play’ (Vygotsky
1978: 102):
This strict subordination to rules is quite impossible in life, but in play it does become possible: thus, play creates a zone of proximal development of the child. In play a child always
behaves beyond his average age, above his daily behaviour; in play it is as though he were
a head taller than himself. As in the focus of a magnifying glass, play contains all developmental tendencies in a condensed form and is itself a major source of development.

This specific aspect of the ZPD deserves attention because it reveals much more
about Vygotsky’s view of the concept. Why should play create a ZPD? And what
has a ZPD to do with a “subordination to rules”? In ‘Mind in Society’, Vygotsky suggests that play “seems to be invented at the point when the child begins to experience unrealizable tendencies” (Vygotsky 1978: 93). And he goes on to state that:
To resolve this tension, the pre-school child enters an imaginary, illusory world in which
the unrealisable desires can be realised, and this world is what we call play. Imagination
is a new psychological process for the child; it is not present in the consciousness of the
very young child, is totally absent in animals, and represents a specifically human form
of conscious activity.

192

12 Vygotsky on concept formation

Interestingly, this account of ‘play’ is also described by Vygotsky in terms of
‘rules’ (Vygotsky 1978: 94):
One could go even further and propose that there is no such thing as play without rules.
The imaginary situation of any form of play already contains rules of behaviour, although
it may not be a game with formulated rules laid down in advance. The child imagines
himself to be the mother and the doll to be the child, so he must obey the rules of maternal behaviour. Sully early noted that, remarkably, young children could make the play
situation and reality coincide. He described a case where two sisters, aged five and seven,
said to each other, ‘Let’s play sisters’. They were playing at reality.

In “playing at reality”, Vygotsky proposes that a child “operates with meanings
detached from their usual objects and actions” (Vygotsky 1978: 98). Sticks, for
example, are now transformed by the child’s imagination into horses. In such
scenarios, the normal relationships between objects and meanings are effectively
inverted; meanings now create rules for objects. Vygotsky goes on to argue that
“what was said about detaching meaning from objects applies equally well to the
child’s own actions. A child who stamps on the ground and imagines herself riding a horse has thereby inverted the action/meaning ratio to meaning/action”
(Vygotsky 1978: 100).
This is precisely why play is “rule bound”. The meanings of words (or forms)
now define, through their rules of inclusion (and exclusion), how an object ought
to behave in a game. For Vygotsky, this critical aspect of play is how a child discovers what is included (and not included) in a particular concept. The ZPD is,
therefore, where form and content work out their dialectical relationships with
each other. As a result, Vygotsky claims that “a child’s greatest self-control occurs
in play” (Vygotsky 1978: 99) and he concludes that “this strict subordination to
rules is quite impossible in life, but in play it does become possible: thus, play
creates a zone of proximal development of the child” (Vygotsky 1978: 102).
A ZPD is thus created when a child plays within a set of ‘rules’ which are
determined by the meanings of his or her concepts. This is a purely internal activity for the child, and it can be carried out alone; it does not require a social context. When the child is ‘being a horse’ or ‘being a mother’ they submit themselves
to the ‘rules’ of their conceptual game and the meanings of the objects they are
imagining. In this activity, they are exploring the entailments (and the boundaries) of specific identities. The notions of ‘horse’ and ‘mother’ have come from
the words of others, but the child is able to work with them alone.
Earlier in this essay, the flawed relationship between ‘form’ and ‘content’ in
the template of ‘secondary dualism’ were discussed. It was noted that, in the conventional model, experiential content comes first, and form is imposed upon it by
the intellect. It was also emphasised that Hegel and Peirce reject this nominalist

12.2 The zone of proximal development

193

approach and argue that the relationship between form and content can also
work in the reverse direction; form can also define content. In Vygotsky’s account
of child play, he adopts this same perspective. As the child plays, they employ
forms, provided by received words, to work out what content is included, or not
included, within a potential concept.
Overall, therefore, Vygotsky lacks some of Peirce’s terminology, but many of
the same features are present in his account of concept formation. In Peirce, the
icon is initially posited, and the indexical entailments of a concept are included,
before being sublated into a symbol. In Vygotsky’s account, in contrast, the ‘indexical’ components of the concept are already present in the initial ‘complexes’ identified by the child. These are then ‘raised up’ to the level of a genuine concept, in a
dialectical ‘leap’, by using a ‘word’ borrowed from the ‘outer speech’ of adults or
peers. In otherwords, the latter imposes ‘form’ onto content at the end of the dialectical process. Indeed, Vygotsky’s references Tolstoy to support this view when
he states that “the truth of this theory, according to Tolstoy’s own words, lies in
the fact that almost always it is not the word itself which is unintelligible, but that
the pupil lacks the concept which would be capable of expressing this word. The
word is almost always available when the concept is ready” (Vygotsky 1994: 357).
As was noted with Peirce, an ‘object of thought’ needs to reside beneath a symbol
for meaning to be created. A symbol alone can never have meaning.
There are also similarities between Peirce and Vygotsky with respect to the
role they give to the imagination. Earlier, it was observed that the creation of
the Peircean icon involves this faculty and this was traced back to Kant. But in
Vygotsky’s account of play, something equally creative occurs in the ZPD. The
child imagines being a ‘mother’ or riding a ‘horse’. Vygotsky does not adopt the
terminology of icon, but the imagination of the child is critical when form is
being imposed on content. Further references to the imagination in the ZPD can
also be found in Vygotsky’s discussion of creativity in the adolescent (Vygotsky
1998: 151–167). Here, ‘fantasy’ is discussed in ways that echo ‘play’ amongst
younger children. Vygotsky points out that the imagination and thinking are
often mistakenly separated from each other when, in fact, the imagination is
vital in creating new concepts. And Vygotsky agrees with Peirce that it is through
the creation of higher-level concepts that the mind can escape the dyadic mechanisms intrinsic to stimulus/response thinking. Vygotsky suggests that “this can
be understood as follows: thinking that is purely concrete, completely devoid of
concepts, is also without fantasy. The formation of concepts brings with it, first
of all, liberation from the concrete situation and the possibility of creativity reprocessing and changing its elements (Vygotsky 1998: 163).
This section has highlighted that it is possible to revise our understanding
of the Vygotskian ZPD; it should be reframed within a perspective which is

194

12 Vygotsky on concept formation

more Hegelian in character. By loosening the hold of modern social constructivist accounts on Vygotsky, the ZPD can be repositioned as an interface where a
child’s concepts are formed, as ‘word meanings’, in an ‘amalgam’ of spontaneous concepts and the adult inputs from outer speech. As such, it can be suggested that the ZPD represents the location where the Vygotskian sublation
takes place. Social constructivist interpretations tend to ignore this Hegelian influence and, therefore, misunderstand Vygotsky’s belief that the ZPD is, in fact,
where the intricate relationships between form and content are resolved.

Part Four: Peirce: The implications of semiotic
concept formation

13 Pragmatism, truth and abduction
In this penultimate chapter, several of the consequences of Peirce’s model of
concept formation are explored in greater detail. These will underpin the revised interpretation of Peirce advanced in this essay by indicating how his semiotics resonates with other parts of his thought. Whilst being acknowledged
as one of the founding fathers of semiotics, Peirce was also an innovator in several other philosophical areas. In particular, he advanced the doctrine of pragmatism and the form of mental inference known as abduction. There is significant
literature on both subjects, and this chapter will not attempt to evaluate them in
detail. However, there is benefit in considering how our understanding of these
topics can be enhanced by the foregoing analysis of Peircean sign theory. Commentators often discuss pragmatism and abduction in ways that are separate from
Peirce’s semiotics. But this obscures their fundamentally semiotic origins. By demonstrating that both his pragmaticism and his theory of abduction are founded in
his sign theory, an understanding of how, and why, Peirce innovated in these
areas can be elucidated.

13.1 Concept formation and pragmatism
In an essay on the influence of Peirce on educational theory, Houser (1987)
quotes Percy making the following observation (Percy 1972: 160):
Charles Peirce was an unlucky man. His most important ideas ran counter to the intellectual currents of his day, were embraced by his friends – and turned into something else.
William James took one idea and turned it into pragmatism which, whatever its value, is
not the same as Peirce’s pragmaticism. Peirce’s triadic theory has been duly saluted by
latter-day semioticists – and turned into a trivial instance of learning theory . . . . Freud
was lucky. The times were ready for him, and he had good enemies. It’s our friends we
should beware of.

The ways in which Peirce’s theory of signs has been misconstrued in the secondary literature have already been explored in this essay. These are, arguably,
what Percy is referring to when he suggests that Peirce’s sign theory has often
been turned into a “trivial instance of learning theory”. But Percy also claims
that James took Peirce’s pragmaticism and turned it into something else. It is
important to assess the validity of this claim and to elucidate Peirce’s intentions
regarding his pragmaticism. Percy’s claim is, in fact, justified; a similar fate befell his philosophical doctrine. In this case, however, Peirce was much more

https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110695854-014

198

13 Pragmatism, truth and abduction

aware of contemporary misinterpretations, and he adopted the term “pragmaticism”, as cited above, as a means of distancing himself from James’s account.
Peirce’s pragmaticism is often viewed as a major theme in his later philosophy
and as something absent from his earlier writings. It is of some significance, in
this context, to find that Peirce acknowledges that this aspect of his philosophy
has links with Hegel. It is worth highlighting that neither Peirce, nor James, were
the first to use the term ‘pragmatic’. James suggests that it was first used by Peirce
in 1878 in ‘How to Make Our Ideas Clear’ (EP1: 124–141; James 1908: 46), but the
term can be found, in Hegel’s discussion of ‘great men’, when he argues that “a
man is what he does” (Hegel 2014: 166). These Hegelian roots have also been acknowledged by other commentators (Nagl 2014: 429–435; Bernstein 2013: 105–123;
Emundts 2015: 611–663) confirming another aspect of Hegel’s influence on Peirce.
And within Peirce’s own work, he even acknowledges his debt. On one occasion,
Peirce states (EP2: 345):
The truth is that pragmaticism is closely allied to the Hegelian absolute idealism, from
which, however, it is sundered by its vigorous denial that the third category (which Hegel
degrades to a mere stage of thinking) suffices to make the world, or is even so much as
self-sufficient. Had Hegel, instead of regarding the first two stages with his smile of contempt, held on to them as independent or distinct elements of the triune Reality, pragmaticists might have looked up to him as the great vindicator of their truth.

To understand Peirce’s pragmaticism, and how it differs from pragmatism, it is
essential to begin with Peirce’s own formulation of it. Perhaps the clearest expression of his ‘Pragmatic Maxim’ can be found in his lecture of 1903 (EP2: 135):
Consider what effects that might conceivably have practical bearings we conceive the object of our conception to have: then, our conception of those effects is the whole of our
conceptions of the object.

This passage is usually interpreted as a statement about the “effects” of an object
upon a perceiver. Thus, commentators conclude that the maxim concerns the
consequences and the future anticipated behaviours of an object and its practical
effects. There are numerous examples of this interpretation in the secondary literature. Here are several, beginning with James’s own:
The pragmatic method in such cases is to try to interpret each notion by tracing its respective practical consequences. What difference would it practically make to any one if this
notion rather than that notion were true?
(James 1908: 45).
Pragmatism, the philosophical doctrine that the meaning of any conception consists in
how that conception may affect behaviour (with behaviour broadly construed to include
thinking)
(Houser 1987: 255).

13.1 Concept formation and pragmatism

199

We can only know what a word or concept means, Peirce asserted, based on its effect
upon the conduct of human behaviour
(Chiasson 2002: 11).
The ‘cash value’ of a word or concept was for them [pragmatists] the difference it made in
life and action. No difference in life, no difference in meaning
(Davis 1972: 88).

These quotations clearly illustrate this emphasis on ‘effects’ in the literature. It is
certainly true that this is an important constituent of Peirce’s own maxim, but this
should not lead to the conclusion that this is all the maxim is about. As Peirce
points out “it must be admitted, in the first place, that if pragmaticism really made
Doing to be the Be-all and the End-all of life, that would be its death” (EP2: 341).
In contrast, for Peirce, the most important part of the maxim can be found in
the last line of his formulation where Peirce highlights the importance of the
“whole of our conceptions of the object”. This is so critical to Peirce that, in his
essay ‘What Pragmatism Is’, he emphasises this part of his definition, in obvious
frustration, using capital letters. He states: “Then your conception of those effects is the WHOLE of your conception of the object” (EP2: 338). With emphasis
now placed on the term ‘whole’, the maxim attracts quite a different meaning. Its
subject matter is effectively reversed; it becomes a proposition concerning what
it is to be a “whole conception”. This transforms the maxim into a philosophical
doctrine about the nature, and structure, of concepts, rather than one concerning
how particular practical ‘effects’ inform a meaning for an individual.
James’s version of the pragmatic maxim, however, ignores Peirce’s emphasis
on the ‘whole conception’ and, instead, gives it a strong psychological slant.
James is primarily concerned with how practical effects inform the meaning of an
object to someone. But this move has major consequences. In his lecture, ‘What
Pragmatism Means’, James re-states the maxim in his own terms. Superficially, it
appears very similar to Peirce’s formulation, but it is entirely different in its underlying import (James 1908: 46–47):
Mr. Peirce, after pointing out that our beliefs are really rules for action, said that, to develop a thought’s meaning, we need only determine what conduct it is fitted to produce:
that conduct is for us its sole significance . . . . . . To attain perfect clearness in our
thoughts of an object, then, we need only consider what conceivable effects of a practical
kind the object may involve – what sensations we are to expect from it, and what reactions we must prepare. Our conception of these effects, whether immediate or remote, is
then for us the whole of our conception of the object, so far as that conception has positive significance at all [my italics].

This new version of the maxim includes most of Peirce’s formulation and James
even mentions the ‘whole of our conception’. But he limits the scope of the
maxim by insisting, twice in this passage, that what is important is how a concept
is conceived “for us”. With this new emphasis, James effectively psychologises

200

13 Pragmatism, truth and abduction

the maxim. It ceases to be a theory about the nature of concepts themselves; it
becomes a thesis about the way meanings are formed for individuals. James, of
course, still maintains that his version of the maxim remains a “doctrine of truth”
(Dea 2014: 478), but he has, in effect, reduced it to a theory of subjective truth and
meaning. To reinforce this, James even claims, on one occasion, that the maxim
can be used to justify the truth content of religious beliefs because of the intrinsic
benefits they have for individuals and society. He claims that pragmatism is “interested in no conclusions but those which our minds and our experiences work
out together, she has no a priori prejudices against theology. If theological ideas
prove to have a value for concrete life, they will be true, for pragmatism, in the
sense of being good for so much” (James 1908: 72–73).
In James’s hands, therefore, the pragmatic maxim ceases to focus on the
character of a ‘whole conception’. Rather, it is a psychological theory regarding
how meaning is made on the basis of practical utility (Misak 2013 54–57; Apel
1981: 5). Turrisi (1997: 29) makes this distinction clear:
Peirce regarded the practical skill of using pragmatic technique as valuable, but not in
any great need of elucidation. By contrast, readers of William James’s works prior to 1903
were treated almost exclusively to descriptions of pragmatic skills and techniques implying its value for practical action. Justifications of pragmatism even later in James’s
works – for example in his 1907 Lowell lectures on pragmatism – are made in terms of its
usefulness, under the presumption that practical utility is its own best defence. [. . .] The
direction of pragmatic studies typified by James’s work – which was not grounded on any
greater justification than efficacy – convinced Peirce that pragmatism had gone too far
without its necessary logical justification.

James’s version, therefore, involves a relativisation of the pragmatic maxim and
this has influenced philosophers later in the twentieth century. Rorty, for example, views modern accounts of pragmatism as follows: “my first characterization
of pragmatism is that it is simply anti-essentialism applied to notions like ‘truth’,
‘knowledge’ language’, ‘morality’, and similar objects of philosophical theorizing” (Rorty 1982: 162). Rorty does criticise such interpretations, but he concludes,
in his own version of neo-pragmatism, that it should be defined in social terms
(Rorty 1982: 165–166):
Let me sum up by offering a third and final characterisation pragmatism: it is the doctrine
that there are no constraints on inquiry save conversational ones – no wholesale constraints
derived from the nature of the objects, or of the mind, or of language, but only those retail
constraints provided by the remarks of our fellow inquirers . . . . There is no method for
knowing when one has reached the truth, or when one is closer to it than before.

Such interpretations of the pragmatic maxim, however, are far from Peirce’s
own intentions. His version of pragmaticism is concerned with what it is for a

13.1 Concept formation and pragmatism

201

concept to mean something, and he believes that this must involve the sum of
what is contained within its “whole conception”. In this construal, the concept
includes all the ‘effects’ of a thing (or an event), but his focus remains resolutely on the concept itself viewed from all possible perspectives – not on how
a particular meaning might be construed by an individual.
This way of thinking about concepts is, of course, something that we have already encountered. Indeed, Peirce’s semiotic theory characterises the concept as
an evolving identity with indexical elements (or ‘effects’) included in it. In ‘How to
Make Our Ideas Clear’, in 1878, Peirce states, referring to a concept (EP1: 131):
To develop its meaning, we have, therefore, simply to determine what habits it produces,
for what a thing means is simply what habits it involves. Now, the identity of a habit depends on how it might lead us to act, not merely under such circumstances as are likely
to arise, but under such as might possibly occur, no matter how improbable they may be
[my italics].

The sum of possible indices (in all future contexts) determines, therefore, the
meaning of a concept. Peirce specifically includes all possible relationships with
the world and not just those observed so far. This view places Peirce’s pragmatic
maxim firmly in the philosophical tradition of Leibniz’s monads and his endeavours to establish ‘real definitions’. And by defining the pragmatic maxim in this
manner, it is evident that Peirce positions it alongside his sign theory. The second
trichotomy of his sign classification is where new identities gather indexical relationships with the world. By means of this semiotic activity a ‘whole conception’
slowly gathers shape. Peirce’s semiotics and his pragmaticism are, therefore,
closely aligned.
This conclusion is supported when Peirce discusses the meaning of terms.
For example, he states that “we can consequently mean nothing by wine but
what has certain effects, direct or indirect, upon our senses; and to talk of something as having all the sensible characters of wine, yet being in reality blood, is
senseless jargon” (EP1: 131). The ‘effects’ present in his pragmatic theory are the
accrued indices of Peirce’s sign theory. This point is also highlighted by Romanini, who observes that “since symbols must embody both indices and icons to
produce reasoning, pragmatism should be considered a corollary of his semeiotic” (Romanini 2014: 216).
Because the notion of identity is implicated in concept formation, it is evident
that the pragmatic maxim must work, as symbols do, at the level of universals.
Hookway, for instance, highlights that the maxim does not apply to singularities –
such as whether Caesar “sneezed three times on the morning he first crossed to
England” (Hookway 2004: 147). Peirce makes this point himself, insisting that the
maxim can only speak of ‘general kinds’ (CP5: 426). And Peirce, as noted, also

202

13 Pragmatism, truth and abduction

maintains that when a claim is made that diamonds are ‘hard’, this is, in fact, a
statement about a class of objects. It may be the case that the next diamond encountered is ‘soft’, and a revision of the initial belief may be required, but this
will either lead to a conclusion that the original definition of diamonds is wrong
(an unlikely outcome), or that a new sub-category of ‘soft’ diamonds should be created (because of the action of Peircean secondness). In this interplay of form and
content, the pragmatic ‘truth’ that ‘ordinary’ diamonds are ‘hard’ would still be
preserved.
Commentators also highlight, and rightly so, the role of context in the operations of pragmatic maxim. But care should be taken with this notion. An emphasis on context can easily slip into an account where meaning itself derives from
context. Such a shift, however, inverts the maxim once more. Hookway, for example, suggests that “a full understanding of the pragmatist maxim probably requires an understanding of our cognitive contexts, of the sorts of information we
should take account of in reflecting about the consequences of our actions in different possible circumstances” (Hookway 2012: 10). At one level, this is correct,
but pragmatists should not conclude that pragmatism is a study of how identities
change when placed in particular contexts. For Peirce, it is the other way around.
Contexts (past, present, and future) are, in fact, what defines the ‘whole conception’. It is these endless possibilities in a relational universe – not context itself –
that determine the nature of meaning.
In summary, Peirce’s pragmatic maxim is often interpreted in ways that
subvert Peirce’s original intentions. His doctrine can become a way of construing
meaning creation at an individual level. This renders his maxim both relativistic
and contextual. But in his own form of pragmaticism, Peirce proposes an account
of how meaning is established, on a relational basis, within a structure of concepts. Peirce argues that it is the summation of effects, or indices, that determines
the meaning of a ‘whole conception’. The purpose of Peirce’s pragmatic maxim is,
therefore, to demonstrate how the meaning of a concept includes potential contexts which are never actualised. It is not to articulate how meaning is determined
for an individual.
It should also be emphasised that this relativisation of Peirce’s maxim has
contributed, to some extent, in the rupture that has emerged between his pragmaticism and his semiotics. But if it is accepted that Peirce, within his ‘speculative grammar’, is providing an account of concept formation, then it becomes
evident that these two aspects of his thought are closely related. As Rosenthal
rightly observes “his pragmatic theory of meaning would seem to be part and parcel of his semiotics” (Rosenthal 1990: 195).

13.2 Peirce’s concept of truth

203

13.2 Peirce’s concept of truth
If Peirce’s pragmatic maxim is properly understood as defining meaning in terms
of the whole of a conception, then this clearly has important consequences for his
concept of truth. Because he maintains that the meaning of a concept is determined by the indices that it includes, this allows Peirce to propose an account of
truth that (re)unites analytic and synthetic versions of it. These are conventionally
separated by philosophers who argue that synthetic truths are contingent, and
refer to the external world, whilst analytic truths are so by virtue of the meanings
of their terms.
In many ways, Peirce’s account of truth parallels that of Leibniz. It makes
sense, therefore, to begin with the latter’s exposition. As highlighted, Peirce’s synthetic model of the world echoes the Leibnizian web of inter-related monads.
These are identities (not things) and they are defined by the sum of their relationships with each other. Leibniz ([1714] 1951: 523–524) thus describes their monadic
interaction as follows:
And as, because the world is a plenum, everything is connected and each body acts upon
every other body, more or less, according to the distance, and by reaction is itself affected
thereby, it follows that each monad is a living mirror, or endowed with internal activity,
representative according to its point of view of the universe, and as regulated as the universe itself.

Peirce is fully aware of this Leibnizian perspective. Indeed, his pupil, John Dewey
echoes this account, in his book on Leibniz, when he states that “the monad is an
individual, but its whole content, its objectivity or reality, is the summation of the
universe which it represents” (Dewey 1888: 57). This Leibnizian framework means
that each monad relates to the universe in a way that uniquely defines it. Semiotically, this comprises the unity of the identity and its indexical relationships. As
outlined earlier, this Leibnizian formulation foreshadows Peirce’s pragmaticism.
Working within this relational model, human knowledge grows through several stages. In Leibnizian terms, the mind moves from ‘clear ideas’ (that simply
indicate that it has recognised an identity), to ‘distinct ideas’ (where the mind
knows the differentiating indexical relations of these identities). Finally, the intellect aspires to ‘perfect ideas’ (which, in most cases, are known only by God).
As observed, this evolution echoes Leibniz’s ascension from ‘nominal definitions’
to ‘real definitions’ – a trajectory which also informs Peirce’s ‘immediate’ and
‘dynamic’ objects. And it follows from this philosophical perspective that truth is
always partial – a particular truth can never reflect full knowledge of an identity
because this would entail knowing all its relationships with the world. As Peirce
states (CP5: 565):

204

13 Pragmatism, truth and abduction

Truth is a character which attaches to an abstract proposition, such as a person might
utter. It essentially depends upon that proposition’s not professing to be exactly true. But
we hope that in the progress of science its error will indefinitely diminish, just as the
error of 3.14159, the value given for π, will indefinitely diminish as the calculation is carried to more and more decimal places.

In this relational universe, the human mind learns, therefore, by degrees. This
clearly has implications for any concept of truth. It suggests that any account of
truth must accommodate the conclusion that concepts contain indexical content. And this is precisely the view found in Leibniz. In a letter to Arnauld, he
states (Leibniz 1686/1989: 337):
It is that always, in every true affirmative proposition, whether necessary or contingent,
universal or particular, the notion of the predicate is in some way included in that of the
subject. Praedicatum inest subjecto [predicates are contained within their subject]; otherwise I do not know what truth is.

This Leibnizian definition of truth resonates with Peirce’s pragmatic maxim.
Leibniz is effectively suggesting that what is contained within a concept (e.g.,
its predicates, or its pragmatic ‘effects’) will ultimately determine what that
concept means. For Peirce, therefore, establishing a truth involves understanding
the predicates that an identity contains. This convergence between Peirce and
Leibniz is seldom noticed in the secondary literature. Bellucci’s article on Leibniz
(Bellucci: 2013) is, however, a notable exception to this. He claims that “Peirce’s
original formulation of the pragmatist principle has its roots in Leibniz’s theory
of cognition” (Bellucci 2013: 339). And he also highlights that Peirce (MS: 649)
talks of “pragmatic adequacy” – thereby referencing the notion of ‘adequate
ideas’ in Spinoza and Leibniz.
To the modern mind, however, Leibniz’s account of truth seems deeply
flawed. He seems to be suggesting that propositions about the world are ‘analytic’ and yet they also assert empirical truths. But Leibniz is writing almost a
century before Kant established his distinction between synthetic and analytic
truths. To the modern reader, Leibniz seems to be proposing that empirical statements are merely tautologies, but what he is really advancing is a way of construing truth that transcends (or rather pre-dates) Kant’s distinction.47

47 This pre-Kantian belief in the mind’s ability to combine analytic and synthetic truths is
also present in the work of Maimon. In his ‘Essay on Transcendental Philosophy’, he suggests
that concepts are formed synthetically, but they are employed analytically. Using the term ‘determinations’ in the same manner as Peirce, he states (Maimon [1790] 2010: 53):
The understanding’s procedure in forming [Bildung] concepts is opposed to its procedure
in judging. In the former case it acts synthetically, but in the latter analytically. In

13.2 Peirce’s concept of truth

205

In Peirce’s account of concept formation, and in his pragmatic maxim, a position can be discerned that equates to Leibniz’s stance. Peircean concepts are
initiated as putative identities (icons), they accrue connections with the world
(indices), and they are encapsulated in symbols. At this higher level, they are incorporated into wider structures with other symbols, forming systems which,
themselves, are internally coherent. Peircean semiotics, therefore, possesses the
requisite elements for a formulation of truth that combines both empirical foundations and internal (analytic) consistency. This is possible because the meanings of
terms are not arbitrarily created through interpretation or codes (as they would be
in ‘secondary dualism’). Instead, they have been fashioned by previous empirical
experience and the continuous actions of secondness. This is why Forster (Forster
2011: 161–166) and Almeder (Almeder 1985: 89) argue that Peirce combines coherence and correspondence theories of truth.48
In addition to this Leibnizian influence on Peirce, the intermediary figure of
Hegel must also be considered. The latter claims that synthetic truths are formed
through a fusion of empirical experience and reason. Hegel proposes, as noted,
that “what is reasonable is actual; and what is actual is reasonable’ (Hegel 2014:
5) and this is echoed in Peirce’s notion of “concrete reasonableness” (CP5: 3).
Hegel, therefore, argues that his dialectical approach results in a framework
“where Notion corresponds to object and object to Notion” (Hegel 1977: 51). This
convergence, again, fuses the modern concepts of analytic and synthetic truth.
Winfield highlights this point when discussing Hegel’s account of truth (Winfield
2006: 30):
This enables the ensuing movement [dialecticism] to be analytic and synthetic at once. As
in logic’s self-thinking of thought, here each advance is synthetic by presenting something not already contained in what precedes it, yet analytic insofar as it provides nothing
that is not contained within the whole that is in the process of determining itself.

forming concepts, it starts from the universal and achieves the particular by means of determinations; on the other hand, in judgments it is the reverse: it thinks the particular
first, and then subsumes it under the universal by omitting determinations; as a result,
the terms subject and predicate must be exchanged in the two cases.
48 It is of note that Peirce does not believe that a ‘correspondence’ theory of truth would be
enough, on its own, to provide a foundation for a concept of truth. This is because truth must
amount to more than an incidental correspondence between propositions and reality. Peirce
argues, for example: “That truth is the correspondence of a representation with its object is, as
Kant says, merely the nominal definition of it” (EP2: 379).

206

13 Pragmatism, truth and abduction

And Houlgate also concurs with Winfield’s view (Houlgate 2005: 38):
Hegelian logic is ‘analytic’ to the extent that it merely renders explicit what is implicit or
unthought in an initial category. However, by explicating the indeterminate category of
being, we do not merely restate in different words what is obviously ‘contained’ in it, we
watch a new category emerge. It is this transformation of categories into new categories
which prevents the development of Hegel’s logic being straightforwardly analytic.

Interestingly, this Hegelian account of truth also has parallels, in the twentieth
century, in Quine’s ‘Two Dogmas of Empiricism’ (Quine: 1951). In this well-known
paper, Quine argues that it is not possible to draw a distinction between analytic
and synthetic truth and he criticises this Kantian division as “an unempirical
dogma of empiricists, a metaphysical article of faith” (Quine 1951: 34). He maintains that it is based on the erroneous conviction that the mind knows the identity of its sense data – a familiar tenet of ‘secondary dualism’. It is this ‘article of
faith’ which leads to the mistaken conclusion that analytic truths are possible because of the meanings of their terms. Quine correctly argues that this results in a
“cleavage between the analytic and the synthetic” (Quine 1951: 38).
This Peircean account of truth does not mean, of course, that empirical
statements are always true. As highlighted earlier (figure 1), it is important to
distinguish between the way concepts are formed and how they are subsequently used in propositions. Although human concepts are fashioned by experience, it does not follow that they are fool proof in their application and
Peirce’s belief in ‘fallibilism’ highlights the importance of secondness. It is this
category that throws up ‘surprises’ and means that human concepts remain
contingent. In this respect, Peirce describes human knowledge in the following
manner (CP5: 589):
It feels from that moment that its position is only provisional. It must then find confirmations or else shift its footing. Even if it does find confirmations, they are only partial. It
still is not standing upon the bedrock of fact. It is walking upon a bog, and can only say,
this ground seems to hold for the present. Here I will stay till it begins to give way.

However, in contrast to the mediating concept of truth proposed here, Forster
suggests that Peirce also adheres to a “consensus theory of truth” (Forster 2011:
167–170). It is worth exploring this aspect of Peircean truth because it illuminates
other features of his position. Peirce certainly talks on occasions of a “community
of inquirers” (EP1: 54), and he also agrees that human discourse helps the growth
of knowledge. But it should be questioned whether Peirce completely adopts a
“consensus theory of truth”; the belief that truth is a matter of what a community
agrees upon.
As discussed, Peirce certainly values social discourse as a means of refining
human concepts, but he stops well short of claiming that social agreement

13.2 Peirce’s concept of truth

207

makes something true. This would slip into a form of social constructivism. Indeed, for Peirce, matters are the other way around. Interactions with other people
represent an additional layer of secondness which helps determine (and thereby
limit) the meanings of previously formed symbols. As a result, Peirce does not believe that propositions are true because we agree about them. Instead, he inverts
the constructivist platform and argues that they are true because we can’t disagree about them. Peirce explains this position as follows (EP1: 52):
The real, then, is that which, sooner or later, information and reasoning would finally result
in, and which is therefore independent of the vagaries of me and you. Thus, the very origin
of the conception of reality shows that this conception essentially involves the notion of a
COMMUNITY, without definite limits, and capable of an indefinite increase of knowledge.

Here, Peirce’s emphasis on a “community” appears to suggest that truth is formed
through social agreement. But Peirce is proposing that a “community of inquirers”
is useful because, in fact, it ensures a more effective grasp of what a particular
‘object of thought’ entails. This happens because a larger number of people will
bring more perspectives to bear on a particular subject matter. True knowledge
(and ‘the real’) is established, therefore, despite “the vagaries of me and you”.
Many inquirers are not beneficial because they form a greater consensus; they are
useful because they afford more opportunities for a lack of consensus (e.g., a lack
of secondness). Lane, in his account of Peirce’s realism (Lane 2018: 35–36), concurs with this point:
A true belief is the satisfying state of mind that practitioners of the method of science will
experience if they apply that method until no further application will cause any change
in what they believe.

And Lane quotes Peirce, who claims that “the real is the idea in which the community settles down” (CP6: 610).
This section should also conclude with a brief discussion of how Peirce’s
concept of truth displays parallels with the philosophy of Kripke. The latter
also proposes that ‘necessary’ truths about the world are possible. Kripke asks,
in ‘Naming and Necessity’, whether the proposition that “gold is a yellow metal
is necessary” (Kripke 1980: 123) and, likewise, “is it a necessary or a contingent
property of gold that it has the atomic number 79?”. Kripke answers that this
must be the case simply because this is what it is to be gold (Kripke 1980: 125):
Given that gold is this element, any other substance, even though it looks like gold and is
found in the very places where we in fact find gold, would not be gold. It would be some
other substance which was a counterfeit for gold. In any counterfactual situation where the
same geographical areas were filled with such a substance, they would not have been filled
with gold. They would have been filled with something else. So, if this consideration is

208

13 Pragmatism, truth and abduction

right, it tends to show that such statements representing scientific discoveries about what
this stuff is are not contingent truths, but necessary truths in the strictest possible sense.

Kripke reaches his conclusion because he proposes a new platform for truth.
Certain truths, for Kripke, are not applied to things. In cases of ‘rigid designation’, identities (or ‘natural kinds’ (Kripke 1980: 116–129)) contain predicates
which are included in their concept. Short (2007: 264) highlights that there are
potential links between this Kripkean idea of ‘rigid designation’ and Peirce’s account of ‘hypostatic abstraction’, because the latter creates ‘placeholders’ which
are empty, but which are open to indexical characterisation.49 Short argues
(Short 2007: 278) that:
We see, then, that terms for natural kinds designate rigidly. Their reference is fixed by the
actual, if unknown, nature of the exemplars in relation to which we have learned to use
them. As with proper names there is, in Putnam’s words, an ‘indexical component’ in our
use of natural kind terms. Water, he says, ‘is stuff that bears a certain similarity relation
to the water around here’’’.

However, this capacity to assert that an identity (e.g., ‘stuff’) exists, even though
we do not know what it consists of, can also be seen in the workings of Peircean
icon. As was noted earlier, the icon also creates an identity which is later filled
out with indices. Kripke shares this perspective in his account of ‘gold’. It is an
empty ‘placeholder’ which is subsequently filled out with indexical properties.
This way of thinking about ‘gold’ as a ‘natural kind’ renders its properties,
through ‘rigid designation’, necessary rather than contingent. And Peirce’s account of the concept of wine (cited in section 13.1) foreshadows this approach.
Unfortunately, Kripke then goes on to suggest that the identity of gold must
have been ‘fixed’ through some prior naming process. As such, the concept of gold
becomes, for Kripke, a socially constructed definition (Kripke 1980: 95):
In general, our reference depends not just on what we think ourselves, but on other people in the community, the history of how the name reached one, and things like that. It is
by following such a history that one gets to a reference.

49 Short (2007: 268) argues that Peirce’s account of ‘hypostatic abstraction’ allows him to introduce a new object into an analysis. It takes a predicate and turns it into a potential ‘object
of thought’. Peirce’s favourite example is Moliere’s play where the doctor says that opium has
a ‘dormitive virtue’. In this case, the cause of sleepiness is not, itself, identified. But it is still
recognised as existing as a potential identity that causes sleep. Peirce states that “this operation of hypostatic abstraction is not quite utterly futile. For it does say that there is some peculiarity in the opium to which sleep must be due; and this is not suggested in merely saying
that opium puts people to sleep.” (CP5: 534). This identity is not yet known, but exists as a
potential placeholder.

13.3 Abduction

209

Kripke concludes, therefore, that “rigid designators” are fixed by a community. In
contrast, for Peirce, it is the combination of icons and indices which enable the
mind to ‘fix’ the content of an ‘object of thought’ and therefore give it meaning.
Leaving this Kripkean byway aside, however, the ‘positing’ of a potential identity, through an icon, appears to create a ‘placeholder’ (without any initial empirical qualities). This enables Peirce to bridge the dualisms between the experiential
and the intellectual, the empirical and the conceptual, and it is this which enables him to establish his own concept of truth. Hegel performs this delicate task
through his notion of Essences. Peirce achieves the same outcome using ‘objects
of thought’ in the sign, whilst Vygotsky utilises the terminology of ‘word meaning’. These notions enable all three thinkers to establish an account of human
knowledge based on mediating concepts which are universally applicable and yet
still empirically contingent.

13.3 Abduction
Peirce was also innovative in relation to his notion of abduction (or ‘hypothesis’,
or ‘retroduction’, as he calls it earlier in his career). His insistence that abduction
is a form of logical inference is well known and remains controversial. Moreover,
like his pragmaticism, his abduction also appears, at first sight, to be quite separate from his semiotics. It belongs, it can be argued, to the philosophy of science
rather than to a discipline that is focused on signs. In a lecture in 1903, however,
Peirce overtly links his theory of abduction to his pragmatism (EP2: 226–241).
Given that Peirce’s pragmatism has already been drawn closer to his sign theory,
it is useful to explore whether his account of semiotic concept formation also elucidates his position on abduction.
Commentators sometimes view Peirce’s notion of abduction as amounting to
little more than the assertion that making a hypothesis is an important stage in
scientific discovery. And there are many examples, given by Peirce, which would
tend to confirm this view. In these accounts, abduction is construed as an initial
stage in any inquiry where a potential solution to an empirical problem is hypothesised (Harris and Hoover 1980: 339). Liszka, for example, cites several examples
of abduction. These include Copernicus’s hypothesis about a heliocentric solar
system, continental drift theory, and the diagnosing hospital patients (Liszka
1996: 64–68). Liszka maintains that “abduction begins with a certain anomaly,
an anomaly that is generated when certain observed phenomena do not fit into a
standard of received pattern of reasoning or hypothesis” (Liszka 1996: 65). Likewise, Misak suggests that an abduction is involved when “a hypothesis or a conjecture is identified that explains some surprising experience – some strange

210

13 Pragmatism, truth and abduction

exception. Consequences are then deduced from this hypothesis and are tested by
induction” (Misak 2013: 48).50
Cooke expands this account by suggesting that abduction is part of Peirce’s
wider model of experience. She argues that secondness, in the form of ‘surprises’,
is able to “constrain our abductions”. She correctly identifies that abduction is
related to the Peircean category of firstness, but she concludes that abduction is
simply part of a general perspective in which assumptions about reality are always open to question. As a result, she concludes that “experience teaches us
through trial and error” (Cooke 2014: 329) and she believes that Peirce may have
influenced Popper “who regards scientific progress as a series of conjectures and
refutations” (Cooke 2014: 329).
But these evaluations both underplay the importance of abduction for
Peirce and its potentially radical role within human cognition. Peirce was far
too great a philosopher to have simply suggested that the mind forms hypotheses. Indeed, Peirce seeks to demonstrate that abduction is a form of logical inference that places it alongside deduction and induction (Burks 1946: 301–306;
Harris and Hoover 1980: 331). This is a far stronger assertion for Peirce to make
and it is one that is certainly more controversial. His claim must be explored,
therefore, to establish whether any connection may exist between abduction
and Peirce’s theory of concept formation.
The idea of ‘hypothesis’ enters Peircean thought at a number of levels. At
the basic level of experience, ‘perceptual judgments’ are described by Peirce as
hypotheses and, as such, they form the very beginnings of empirical knowledge. Peirce argues that (EP2: 227):
Abductive inference shades into perceptual judgment without any sharp line of demarcation between them; or in other words our first premisses, the perceptual judgments, are
to be regarded as an extreme case of abductive inferences, from which they differ in
being absolutely beyond criticism. The abductive suggestion comes to us like a flash. It is
an act of insight, although of extremely fallible insight.

Additionally, when a sign is first initiated, it has been suggested that the Peircean icon should be viewed as a hypothesis based on conjectured similarity,
or what Peirce also calls “colligation” (EP2: 22; EP2: 46). In the case of both
50 Misak notes that “Peirce is silent about Hume’s problem of induction” (Misak 2013: 48). She
ascribes this to the fact that induction is only a problem “if you are looking for certainty” (Misak
2013: 49) and that “Peirce is not interested in showing that induction delivers us certainty”
(Misak 2013: 49). But, as noted earlier, Peirce also rejects the atomisation of perceptions. This is
a key requirement for induction to become a philosophical problem because it severs the potential links between perceptions. It is largely because Peirce rejects such mistaken atomisation
that he views Hume’s problem of induction as not warranting consideration.

13.3 Abduction

211

‘perceptual judgments’ and icons, therefore, abduction is closely related to
firstness. This is the Peircean category of ‘possibility’ where the imagination
plays an active role in sign formation. When talking about hypothetical inference, Peirce describes it in terms that overtly reference this quality of firstness. He states, for example, that “hypothetic inference” involves “a single
feeling of greater intensity [my italics]” (EP1: 198–199).
But what is also fundamental to Peirce’s notion of abduction is that it has a
logical character. At first glance, this is at odds with Peirce’s suggestion that abduction concerns feelings and the imagination. Turrisi (1990: 495) captures this
apparent paradox. Describing Peircean abduction, she says that “his concept of a
logic of creativity has been the source of a persistent controversy. Is it not the
case, many critics have said, that creativity is a psychological and not a logical
affair?”. Many commentators, such as Frankfurt (1958: 593–597), have also argued
that Peirce is mistaken in making claims about abduction’s logical status. Others,
such as Tschaepe, have, in contrast, argued that this feature of abduction is, after
all, simply a matter of reasoning: “For Peirce, it makes perfect sense to speak of a
logic of guessing because guessing is a reasoning process through which ideas
are deliberately created and initially selected or dismissed” (Tschaepe 2014:122).
But Peirce claims more than that abduction is simply rational and, in his
defence, it has been observed that there is a particular notion at the heart of his
semiotics – that of identity. Using this insight, it is possible to bring into view the
logical character of abduction. In our earlier evaluation of Peirce’s concept of
truth, it was noted that predicates are included within an identity. It makes sense,
therefore, to consider the inferential activity of abduction in this philosophical
context. Simply put, it can be argued that Peircean abduction is a form of logical
inference because it involves hypotheses derived from a known identity.
To understand this point more fully, some of Peirce’s examples of abduction should be highlighted. One of the best known is the case of the white
beans. He argues (EP1: 188) that abduction represents the following kind of logical inference under the heading of “hypothesis:’
Rule: All the beans from this bag are white
Result: These beans are white
Case: These beans are from this bag
And Peirce goes on to say (EP1: 189) that:
Hypothesis is where we find some very curious circumstance, which would be explained
by the supposition that it was a case of a certain general rule, and thereupon adopt that

212

13 Pragmatism, truth and abduction

supposition. Or, where we find that in certain respects two objects have a strong resemblance, and we infer that they resemble one another in other respects.

Considering the white beans from the point of view of identity, their resemblance involves much more than ‘guesswork’. The beans in the ‘result’ line
share a predicate (being ‘white’) with the beans from the bag. It is a predicate
which, because it involves a ‘perceptual judgment’, “contains general elements” (EP2: 229). In otherwords, the two sets of beans don’t just have two singular predicates attached to them – instead, they partake (like an icon) of the
same general predicate. Whiteness is, therefore, contained in both identities
and this is something which may potentially connect them.51 As a result, Peirce
argues that the mind is justified in asserting, and on a logical basis, that the
white beans are potentially from the bag. This is because it has identified a resemblance between two identities based on the shared predicate. Therefore,
Peirce describes abduction as “a method of forming a general predication” (EP2:
299). It involves working backwards from a shared predicate (that belongs to a
class) to an identity from which the intellect is entitled to make a logical inference. Indeed, this may explain why Peirce initially calls this form of inference
‘retroduction’ – for it retraces implicit connections which may exist because the
mind always perceives things as members of classes.52
In another example, Peirce discusses the nineteenth century concept of a
‘mugwump’. In this passage, from 1892, he has yet to adopt the terminology of
abduction (Gambarato 2013: 425; Mcauliffe 2015: 302). He is still using the notion
of “hypothetic inference” (EP1: 328):

51 It is, perhaps, useful to reflect on the differences between Peirce’s suggestion that the mind
can identify a possible iconic similarity, and the semiological claim to identify a paradigm.
This latter claim was discussed, and rejected, in chapter two, because there is no criterion to
establish whether a paradigm exists. Saussure and Barthes require prior knowledge of the associative axis to perform this task. Such knowledge is not required, however, when Peirce simply hypothesises a similarity between two experiences. The icon, as a result, needs no
justification to become a possible form of knowledge. Peirce’s identification of potential similarities in the world creates icons that positively inform the world. In contrast, their insistence
on their prior knowledge of the signifier means that Saussure and Barthes are trapped within a
system requiring pre-existing knowledge to explain meaning. It is this claim that, inevitably,
leads them to conclude that meaning is culturally formed.
52 The reader will note that Peirce’s philosophical move here echoes icon formation. The latter is
a hypothetical identity partaking of a general similarity (it is a member of a class which can be
further determined). The icon is not, as a result, a similarity established between two known identities. Likewise, in abduction, Peirce claims that the predicate ‘white’ is general, rather than singular,
because it is relationally defined. As a result, he claims the intellect is justified in hypothesising
that a bean may possess other predicates because it belongs to the same class.

13.3 Abduction

213

By hypothetical inference, I mean, as I have explained in other writings, an induction
from qualities. For example, I know that the kind of man known and classed as a ‘mugwump’ has certain characteristics . . . . [Peirce lists here the opinions of a ‘mugwump’ at
length] . . . . These views, among others, I know to be the obtrusive marks of a ‘mugwump’. Now, suppose I casually meet a man in a railway-train, and falling into conversation find that he holds opinions of this sort; I am naturally led to suppose that he is a
‘mugwump’. That is hypothetic inference. That is to say, a number of readily verifiable
marks of a ‘mugwump’ being selected, I find this man has these, and infer that he has all
of the other characters which go to make a thinker of that stripe.

Here is a similar pattern of inference, but Peirce now suggests that a set of observed predicates can lead to a hypothesised identity. This contrasts with the
white beans where only one predicate was used to make an inference. Again, however, Peirce still works back to a conclusion from certain observed qualities – abductive inference enables him to replace a collection of predicates with one
concept, or identity. This mental act simplifies his understanding of the world in a
way that, again, echoes the formation of an icon. As Peirce argues (EP1: 198–199):
Hypothesis substitutes, for a complicated tangle of predicates attached to one subject, a
single conception. Now, there is a peculiar sensation belonging to the act of thinking that
each of these predicates inheres in the subject. In hypothetic inference this complicated
feeling so produced is replaced by a single feeling of greater intensity, that belonging to
the act of thinking the hypothetic conclusion.

Of course, this kind of inferential thinking is entirely anathema to the nominalist.
In ‘secondary dualism’ an identity is created by the inspecting mind; it is something that is only conferred by the intellect. In nominalism, an identity would be
incapable of forming a logical basis for abductive inference. Once, however, it is
acknowledged that identities are created through ‘perceptual judgments’, by
icons, or in ‘thirds’, then it becomes possible to entertain a logical basis for abductive inference. As Peirce explains, in ‘Pragmatism as the Logic of Abduction’,
abduction is rooted in the “conception of character” (EP2: 233).
Going back to the example of the white beans, the importance of relations
in Peirce’s formulation of abduction should also be highlighted. It has been observed that Peircean concepts are formed on a relational basis. It follows from
this that subject/predicate relationships should not be treated as incidences (as
assumed in the atomistic model of ‘secondary dualism’). Instead, relationships
with the world are integral features of perceptions, concepts, and the identities
which they create. It follows that any observed relationship in the world can always be thought of, in Leibnizian terms, as a small fragment of a ‘real definition’.
As a result, the mind can use an observed relationship (e.g., all the beans from
this bag are white) to infer other properties (e.g., these beans are from this bag).
It is important to emphasise, however, that such claims to logical inference are

214

13 Pragmatism, truth and abduction

deeply rooted in Peirce’s ‘containment’ theory of truth. The mind can infer backwards, in this abductive manner, only because there might be a connection between a subject and a predicate based on identity rather than mere incidence.
This interpretation concurs with the view of Turrisi (1990: 465–497), who argues that abductive inference should be construed through the lens of Peirce’s
“doctrine of realism” (Turrisi 1990: 465). Turrisi, however, tends to focus on Peirce’s three categories, and his ‘perceptual judgments’, as means of establishing the
philosophical foundations of abduction. She is less inclined to relate abduction to
the idea of identity or, indeed, to the action of signs (Turrisi 1990: 495):
These basic [universal] categories, he claimed, enter into the constitution of every phenomenon or fact of perception. An abduction is an application of the logic of categoric
relations in a systematic interrogation of the specific character of the categoric structure
of a particular idea or matter of fact. Each step in an abductive inference is a perceptual
judgment or an abstractive perception of a categoric relation, a generality.

But it is evident that Peirce’s notion of abduction involves much more than a simple conjecturing of hypotheses. What Peirce has identified is an important philosophical consequence of human knowledge if it forms a semiotic web of
interrelated identities. Created through semiosis, these identities allow the
mind to work backwards, from observed predicates to hypothesised identities, or from one predicate to others. This is only possible because predicates
are already embedded in these relationally formed identities. When the
mind encounters a predicate included in an identity, it can hypothesise that
it is dealing with a similar type of identity because such identities are real
rather than interpreted. In this Peircean account, abduction becomes a logical form of inference founded on a non-nominalistic account of identity.
This way of construing empirical knowledge derives, of course, from Peirce’s
sign theory which shows how synthetic concepts are created. It also resonates with his concept of truth and his doctrine of pragmatism. Abduction
should, therefore, be viewed as a direct outcome of Peirce’s semiotics.

14 Peircean semiotics and learning theory
It is now possible to summarise Peirce’s semiotic understanding of cognition,
human knowledge, and reality, and compare them with the conventional templates of ‘primary’ and ‘secondary dualism’.
‘Primary dualism’ advocates a vision of reality comprising physical objects
located in three-dimensional space. The mind of the perceiver (res cogitans) is
separated from reality (res extensa) by a Cartesian divide. In response to this initial
division, ‘secondary dualism’ is sometimes invoked by philosophers as a possible
way to circumvent the problems of ‘primary dualism’, but this move, in fact, only
makes matters worse. The intellect, within this new framework, only experiences
reality via representational ‘sense impressions’ and this creates a threefold problem. Firstly, human sense data become, paradoxically, a barrier to knowledge of
the ‘noumenal’ world which may (or may not) exist ‘beyond’ experience. Secondly, these sense impressions atomise experience in such a way that the mind
no longer perceives the connections between them. And, thirdly, the notion of
‘sense impressions’ gives rise to the misleading belief that they offer direct knowledge of human experience (‘The Myth of the Given’).
In these circumstances, a set of very familiar philosophical problems arise:
human knowledge is rendered interpretative, subjective, relative, or even ideological in nature. At the same time, this template has led to the emergence of
social constructivist theories of knowledge, the rise of postmodernism, and the
problems of the ‘post-truth age’. Paradoxically, however, this same cognitive
model has acquired such hegemony over the modern mind that it, simultaneously, also forms the basis of the physical sciences. This is because science
believes that it solves the very problems presented by ‘secondary dualism’. The
scientific method claims to establish knowledge of the external world by conferring new status on the ‘constant conjunctions’ observed between atomised
sense impressions. Using statistical methods, these are translated into the ‘necessary connections’ of cause and effect.
In this essay, our discussion has explored the alternative templates of cognition, knowledge, and reality espoused by Peirce and Hegel. Their accounts are
based on the central proposition that the mind’s cognitive world is formed, not of
physical objects, but of identities (signs or Notions). These are defined by their relationships with each other, and their meanings are formed by what is included
within their concepts, rather than by empirical correspondence. Moreover, because these identities are relationally defined, reality forms a synechistic ‘web’
where these identities reciprocally reflect with each other. In this model, human
knowledge, like reality itself, becomes relational in character. Such knowledge is
https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110695854-015

216

14 Peircean semiotics and learning theory

not ‘constructed’ by the mind interpreting its sense impressions, but rather it is
created by the dialectical/semiotic way in which concepts are formed. Such empirical knowledge, even though it remains partial in character, should not be viewed,
however, as subjective. This would imply (in dualistic fashion) that it is relative to
reality. In contrast, Hegel, and Peirce both insist that empirical knowledge grows
as the mind creates mediating concepts which fuse together subjective and objective elements. Concepts thus evolve, in Vygotskian fashion, into semiotic ‘tools’
which the human mind uses to navigate the world. Their only limitation is that
they necessarily remain open to revision and further determination.
Peirce thus asserts that the mind experiences reality through the mediation
of the synthetic identities which he calls signs. These identities have not been
arbitrarily plucked from the air – as they would be in the nominalistic model of
‘secondary dualism’. Rather, they are fashioned by the mind’s encounters with
reality when icons are first posited and then qualified by secondness. This semiotic activity renders these identities (e.g., interpretants) pragmatically efficient.
The underlying trajectory of sign activity – semiosis – is not, as a result, a matter
of (subjective) interpretations of signs being built upon earlier (subjective) interpretations of other signs; rather the arc of semiosis involves a convergent determination of semiotic identities.
This activity also involves a constant interplay between content and form.
In the model of ‘secondary dualism’ form can only be applied to content; it is,
effectively, a one-way street. For Hegel and Peirce, however, form and content
work in both directions because content (via Hegelian dialecticism, or Peircean
secondness) can reflexively qualify form. The outcome of such activity is a system of concepts which have not been created through interpretation. Instead,
they possess a logical character – a consequence of the fact that they contain
only the indexical links that reality has allowed them to contain. Peirce thus
envisages a Leibnizian version of truth which combines both analytic and synthetic elements. And within this semiotic view of human knowledge is entailed
Peirce’s rejection of Cartesian dualism, his synechism, and the system of ‘natural propositions’ present in his third trichotomy. And, as discussed above, it
also forms the foundations of his pragmatism and his advocacy of abduction as
a form of logical inference.
The system adopted by Hegel and Peirce, of course, differs from that of Spinoza and Leibniz because the two earlier philosophers structured their accounts of reality on a framework that involved God. Identities, in the form of
Leibnizian monads, or Spinoza’s determinations of a single divine substance, were
construed, as a result, as pre-existing human experience. It followed that they
were empirically discoverable by the human mind. In the systems of Hegel and
Peirce, however, identities are created at the interface where the mind interacts

14.1 The learning process: ‘semiotic scaffolding’?

217

with empirical experience. In this process, Hegel’s Essences evolve, through his
dialecticism, into Notions and the ‘Absolute Idea’. For Peirce, in contrast, ‘objects
of thought’, embedded within the triadic sign, ascend to the level of sublated
symbols and systems of symbols. But both approaches share a common rejection
of Cartesian dualism.
The empirical knowledge formed in both Hegel’s and Peirce’s systems is
synthetic in nature. It is not entirely created by the mind but is formed through
the constant interaction of the mind and reality; it is, as a result, mediatory in
nature. Vygotsky shares this Hegelian view – he only differs in selecting an alternative source of ‘form’. He believes that it derives from the speech of others
rather than through a Hegelian/Peircean positing of an initial identity. As discussed, the Peircean, and Vygotskian forms of synthetic mediation which emerge
in this process differ radically from conventional interpretations of mediation
often found in the secondary literature. These frequently construe ‘mediation’ as
the sign mediating between the object and the mind or communicating between
individuals. In such construals, the sign is reduced to little more than a special
kind of sense impression or, indeed, a social construct. In both cases this way of
understanding Peirce and Vygotsky adheres to the underlying framework of ‘secondary dualism’. In contrast, Peirce views the object in the sign as a mediating
locus, where the synthesis of the empirical and the intellectual takes place. Vygotsky, echoing Peirce, views ‘word meaning’ as a synthetic ‘amalgam’. It follows
from both theoretical positions that human beings live in a world that is both
formed semiotically and which can be understood semiotically.

14.1 The learning process: ‘semiotic scaffolding’?
In this analysis, Peircean semiotics is reframed as a mechanism for understanding the empirical world. This revision also opens the possibility of extending the
remit of biosemiotics to include any entity (including physical objects) which
begin their ‘natural history’ as ‘objects of thought’. The very atoms and molecules
of reality can be construed, therefore, as being semiotically formed. As such,
Peircean semiotics can also contribute substantially to educational learning theory. The fact that this has not always been the case is testament to the lingering
belief amongst some semioticians that Peircean signs, construed as interpretations, are phenomena which intrinsically distort human understanding of reality.
There are indications, however, that this perspective is changing, and that
Peircean semiotics is becoming an increasingly important aspect of learning theory. The growing influence of Edusemiotics is evidence that semiotics is expanding beyond its origins in linguistic and cultural studies. Pioneers in this area

218

14 Peircean semiotics and learning theory

include Stables (2008) and Olteanu (2015) who have both adopted a Peircean approach to educational learning theory. Stables argues that semioticians should
abandon Cartesian dualism and should apply the implications of Peircean thought
to educational frameworks. Learning is not a matter of the teacher transmitting
information to the student across a Cartesian divide (Stables 2010: 21). Instead, educationalists should think of the learning process as “semiotic engagement” –
with the learner as an active participant in the process (Stables 2008: 89). Meanwhile, Olteanu maintains that insufficient attention has been paid the role of
signs in learning theory and that the philosophy of education must rediscover its
“semiotic foundation” (Olteanu 2015: 22). Olteanu, in particular, discusses the
icon and its potential role in “diagrammatic reasoning” (Olteanu 2015: 193–204)
as a way of understanding child learning. Elsewhere, Nöth suggests that, in a relational world which has no boundaries, educationalists should move away from
a strict compartmentalisation of academic subjects (Nöth 2010: 4). As a result,
edusemiotics also challenges the conventional divisions between the sciences
and the arts.
Despite all these developments, however, there remain considerable barriers to the integration of Peircean semiotics and educational understanding of
the learning process. Stables has suggested, for example, that there may be difficulties “in taking Peirce as the basis of a fully semiotic theory of education”
(Stables 2014: 598). The underlying challenge has always been to show how Peircean semiotics details an account of the learning process itself. In otherwords, it
has not been clear how his vision of semiotics explains concept formation. It is,
of course, this aspect of learning theory that has established Vygotsky’s status
within the philosophy of education; he offers a model of how a child’s concepts
are formed. It has been argued that Vygotsky’s commentators over emphasise
the social aspects of this process and have tended, as a result, to marginalise the
Hegelian influences in his thought. But Vygotsky remains a central figure in educational theory and his status suggests that it may be possible for Peirce to claim
similar credentials – based upon the same Hegelian template.
One of the aims of this essay, therefore, has been to demonstrate the potential for Peircean semiotics in relation to educational learning theory. Indeed, this
is one of the reasons why Vygotsky and Peirce have been brought together in
this discussion. It has highlighted their theoretical convergences and has sought
to demonstrate how Vygotsky’s Hegelian heritage is shared with Peirce. The benefits of this are potentially far reaching for educationalists. The possibility exists
to develop a new form of ‘cognitive semiotics’ which explains how children create their own concepts and construe their world through signs. Such an analysis
draws Peirce closer into the mainstream of educational learning theory. In this

14.1 The learning process: ‘semiotic scaffolding’?

219

final chapter, however, it is possible to identify ways in which Peirce’s own semiotic perspective can enhance, and extend, that of Vygotsky’s.
One of the problems with Vygotsky’s account of concept formation is that it is
relatively easy to view it as a psychological and social theory rather than a semiotic one. As discussed, commentators on Vygotsky underplay the Hegelian elements in his theory and focus on the more social aspects of his thought. This
opens a significant gap in Vygotskian exegesis – one which Peirce’s account of
concept formation can fill in ways accessible to the modern educationalist. This is
the case for several reasons. Firstly, the dynamic of Peirce’s sign theory avoids Hegel’s dialecticism and replaces it with the notion of secondness. This may act as
some relief to those who feel uncomfortable with the intellectual baggage that dialecticism may entail. Secondly, the fact that reality plays this role in concept formation gives Peirce’s own sign theory a strong empirical flavour which renders it
more accessible to modern readers. Thirdly, it can be argued that Peirce’s account,
once properly understood, is applicable to learning theory simply because it provides a clear, and practical, framework for concept formation. Peirce, as has been
discussed, breaks down the “natural history of the sign” into more stages than Vygotsky. These are pre-semiotic ‘perceptual judgments’, the initial formation of
icons, the addition of indices, and the final sublation of the emerging identity into
a symbol. This Peircean template provides a potential framework through which
educationalists can understand a child’s concept development.
Through the work of Bruner, Vygotsky is often associated with the idea of
‘scaffolding’. But, as highlighted, this concept is often misinterpreted as involving
social aspects operating within the ZPD. Indeed, as Campbell, Olteanu and Kull
point out, the notion of ‘scaffolding’ is curiously absent from much of semiotic discourse (Campbell, Olteanu, Kull 2019: 355). These authors highlight, for example,
that the term has no entry in five semiotic dictionaries between 1993 and 2010. As
a concept, it seems to have been entirely co-opted by social constructivists and
has been distanced, as a result, from mainstream semiotics. But it can be argued,
and persuasively so, that the real proponent of a framework of different stages in
concept formation is Peirce himself. He outlines, in more detail than Vygotsky,
how concepts develop through the combinatory interactions of the three elements
of the sign and his three categories. Peirce does not talk, of course, in terms of
‘scaffolding’, but the stages in the development of an emerging ‘object of thought’
mirror that notion very closely. Peirce’s sign theory, therefore, offers educational
theorists the possibility of tracing the ‘natural history’ of a particular sign and
doing so, moreover, in the context of an individual child.
Applying Peirce’s approach to concept formation, it is possible to discern the
contours of a semiotic template for the learning process. On occasions, for example, Peirce talks about the structure of human concepts in terms of their ‘breadth’

220

14 Peircean semiotics and learning theory

and ‘depth’. These two dimensions, within signs, demarcate the limits of their
synthetic meaning. The ‘breadth’ of a sign is limited by the actions of secondness, and its ‘depth’ is determined by the predicates that it includes – based on a
child’s experience of the world. Peirce states, for example (EP2: 305):
The totality of the predicates of a sign, and also the totality of the characters it signifies,
are indifferently each called its logical depth. This is the oldest and most convenient
term. Synonyms are the comprehension of the Port-Royalists, the content (Inhalt) of the
Germans, the force of De Morgan, the connotation of J.S. Mill. (The last is objectionable).
The totality of the subjects, and also, indifferently, the totality of the real objects of a
sign, is called the logical breadth. This is the oldest and most convenient term. Synonyms
are the extension of the Port-Royalists (ill-called extent by some modern French logicians),
the sphere (Umfang) of translators from the German, the scope of De Morgan, the denotation of J.S. Mill.

Peirce concludes that it is this combination of the ‘breadth’ and the ‘depth’ of
signs which provides the human mind with synthetic ‘information’ (EP2: 305).
In the above citation, however, it should also be noted that Peirce insists that
he is concerned with a sign’s logical ‘breadth’ and ‘depth’. As explained earlier,
the content of a sign is logical because it has been fashioned through the effects
of experience. The meaning of a sign includes only what has been permitted by
previous experience. Such an analysis reflects Leibniz’s exposition of ‘clear’ and
‘distinct’ ideas whereby the former distinguishes one idea from another (on a horizontal dimension), whilst the latter details the contents of the sign (on a vertical
dimension). If this thinking is applied to the learning experience of a child, it is
possible to outline a model to explain their grasp of particular concepts. This can
be achieved, at a practical level, by asking a child where the ‘edges’ of a particular concept exist. For example, when does a ‘chair’ became a ‘sofa’, or when does
a ‘killing’ become ‘murder’? Such enquiries may be dismissed by secondary dualists as debates about ‘nominal’ definitions. In the Peircean model, however, these
questions allow the exploration of the inclusions in a child’s concepts and the
way in which they are structured.
These enquiries may also help us understand the respective roles of ‘form’
and ‘content’ in a child’s concepts. For Peirce offers a semiotic template which
allows the educationalist to identify how a concept is structured.53 For example,
when a child uses a concept, it is possible to ask the following type of questions:

53 A theoretical template that can be adopted to understand the inclusions in a particular concept is eloquently explained by Leibniz in a monograph called ‘On Wisdom’ (Leibniz 1693
[1951]: 78–79):
The art of discovery consists of the following maxims:

14.1 The learning process: ‘semiotic scaffolding’?

221

What kinds of ‘perceptual judgment’ are being made? How does a child
classify a specific element of the world?
Which elements of an experience does a child ‘pick out’ when they form an
icon? In otherwords, how are distinctions, based on similarity, being made?
Once these putative identities are formed, how are they subsequently ‘filled
out’ with indexical components? In other words, how are a child’s icons
subsequently determined?
Does any sublation take place as an emerging concept develops? Does the
child invert the relationship between the indices and the emerging identity
in a way that means that the former now act as signs of the latter?

But the usefulness of Peirce’s semiotic structure is not limited to these kinds of
examinations. It is also possible to identify a clear order effect in concept formation which has important effects at an applied level. The Peircean icon is created in such a way that subsequent indices serve to qualify it. This means that
there will always be an implicit hierarchy in a child’s concepts. For example, in
a bedtime story, a child may form the concept of ‘wolf’. This will involve an initial icon (of an evil animal?) and a series of subsequent qualifications (derived
from the details of the story). It matters greatly on what basis the initial icon (of
a wolf) is picked out and how that identity is then qualified. If, in the story, the
child has negative experiences of wolves, then these qualifications may inform

In order to become acquainted with a thing we must consider all of its prerequisites, that is, everything which suffices to distinguish it from any other thing. This
is what is called definition, nature, essential property.
After we have found a means of distinguishing it from every other thing, we must
apply this same rule to the consideration of each condition or prerequisite entering
into this means, and consider all the prerequisites of each prerequisite. And that is
what I call true analysis, or the distribution of the difficulty into several parts.
When we have pushed the analysis to an end, that is, when we have considered
the prerequisites entering into the consideration of the proposed thing, and even
the prerequisites of the prerequisites, and finally have come to considering a few
natures understood only by themselves without prerequisites and needing nothing outside themselves to be conceived, then we have arrived at a perfect knowledge of the proposed thing.

Although, as a methodological approach, this may seem quite daunting, Leibniz does not expect
the human mind to achieve such ‘perfect knowledge’. When analysing a child’s concepts, it may
be that only a few levels of analysis are required to understand its main contents. Leibniz, of
course, positions this approach as an ‘art of discovery’ because he assumes that his subject matter
is reality itself. In the hands of Hegel and Peirce, however, it remains largely an analysis of concepts because the subject matter is formed (at least partially) by the human mind.

222

14 Peircean semiotics and learning theory

the child thinking about wolves for years to come. But if the initial icon formed is
positive (admittedly, an unlikely event in children’s story books!), then the icon,
and its subsequent developmental pathway, may be very different. The critical
point here, of course, is that if the child forms an initial negative identity, then it
will take many subsequent qualifications to reframe it. This compares to a scenario where the concept of ‘wolf’ begins its ‘natural history’ as a positive identity.
This order effect in sign formation can be observed in the meanings that
signs create. It matters, for example, whether the mind construes an individual as
a ‘parent who steals’, or as a ‘thief who has children’. The initial identity determines the subsequent qualifications of it. The nominalist, of course, views this as
merely a subjective way of speaking about the same person (because identities
are always nominal). However, it is clearly useful to think of human concepts as
possessing these intrinsic hierarchies. Concepts are not simple collections of
ideas or associations in the mind (e.g., the associative view criticised by Vygotsky); rather they involve specific order-effects determined by the respective actions of iconicity and indexicality. In an educational setting, therefore, it might be
beneficial to explore how an individual (who has, perhaps, prejudicial views
about race, for example), has formed their concept of a person from an ethnic minority. What kind of icon have they initially formed, on what basis, and what are
the specific qualifications that they have attached to this identity? This might be a
first step in helping such an individual form a more enlightened concept.
Importantly, this kind of semiotic analysis can be conducted by talking
with children. Educationalists can employ Peirce’s template to identify how a
child has formed (or, indeed, has failed to form) a particular concept and why it
has a certain structure. It is thus possible to reframe the notion of ‘scaffolding’
in an applied way – based on Peircean sign formation.

14.2 Peirce’s logic and semiotic freedom
Peirce’s semiotic template thus has the potential to both enhance our understanding of the empirical world and the educational learning process. Peirce provides a clear account of concept formation, and he does so in a way that gives a
significant role to empirical input at the individual level. These two aspects are
more difficult to discern in Vygotsky’s work because of his greater emphasis on
dialectics and the role of ‘outer speech’ in meaning making.
There is one element of Peirce’s theory, however, that is likely to encounter
resistance in contemporary educational circles. This is the emphasis that he
gives to the idea of logic in concept formation – a perspective that he inherits
from Hegel. Referring to the passage earlier in this chapter, Peirce talks of the

14.2 Peirce’s logic and semiotic freedom

223

“logical breadth”, and the “logical depth” of the sign. For Peirce, knowledge is
a matter of logic because it is through a logical process that human concepts
are formed. He states, as a result, echoing Hegel, that “everything that is true is
logical, whether we know it or not” (EP2: 255). Moreover, on one occasion,
Peirce even asserts that “a liberal education – as far as its relation to the understanding goes – means logic” (EP1: 212).
The reason that Peirce claims that signs have “logical breadth”, and “logical
depth”, is that their meanings are determined by reality itself. This position, as
discussed earlier, underpins his pragmaticism and supports Stjernfelt’s claims
concerning ‘natural propositions’. A child cannot decide, arbitrarily, upon the
contents of their own concepts; it is a matter of logic what empirical concepts
contain.
This conclusion, however, flies in the face of contemporary educational
thinking which insists that freedom, in a liberal education, springs from the
very fact that a child can interpret the world in their own terms. This principle
is often combined with the argument (which Peirce would have endorsed) that
the child learns most effectively through exploration and trial and error – rather
than through rote learning. Peirce’s suggestion that logic is involved in the
learning process, however, seems to undercut the claim that education should
be experiential. However, such arguments are, thankfully, misplaced. They
only appear to be valid if educationalists mistakenly conflate Peirce’s invocation of logic with a form of analytical thinking which excludes empirical inputs.
In conventional models of meaning-making the assumption that individual
interpretation creates meaning supports the liberal claim that a child must possess individual freedom when forming their concepts. This is a view which is
deeply embedded in the modern semiotic tradition. Wheeler (2006: 124) argues,
for example, that:
The evolution of self-consciousness, language and culture is the emergent form in which
human animals signify and remember; and through this they enter into a new stratum in
which, for the first time on this planet, we can entertain the hope of bringing our intelligence to bear upon the future in more than the immediate ways characteristic of other
animals. In the latter, later evolutionary forms exhibit more semiotic freedom than earlier
forms. Human semiotic freedom, our capacity to bring our intelligence and other capabilities to bear on the future, is thus very closely tied to the human experience of hope.

Likewise, Hoffmeyer suggests that semioticians should “ . . . regard signs as a
phenomenon that has, in the course of evolution, freed itself more and more
from what it signified, or – in the parlance of this book – acquired greater and
greater semiotic freedom” (Hoffmeyer 1996: 78). In conventional terms, therefore,
the mind’s ability to interpret signs has become closely aligned in the literature
with the idea of human freedom. Within educational theory, this perspective is

224

14 Peircean semiotics and learning theory

often raised to a higher level where it becomes systematised as a form of social
constructivism. It is maintained, as a result, that subjective meanings are individually and collectively created. Such positions have become, as Phillips (1995: 5)
observes “something akin to a secular religion” in education theory. Stables confirms this view, observing that “social constructionism [. . .] is arguably the dominant educational philosophy at the time of writing, at least in the European and
English-speaking worlds” (Stables 2008: 106). It seems, as a result, that Peirce’s
appeal to logic may run contrary to the modern educational demand for interpretative freedom in the learning process and the associated desire to encourage
child creativity.
Peirce’s position, however, is not inimical to the idea of semiotic freedom. His
appeal to logic only suggests a potential problem if it is assumed that logic and
freedom are binary opposites. Such a perspective, of course, stems from the view
that logic must involve analytic truth, and this will impinge on human freedom
through deterministic necessity. But it has already been indicated that Peirce’s vision of truth circumvents this problem. In advocating a form of truth that transcends Kant’s conventional analytic/synthetic division, Peirce supports a position
which allows concepts to be simultaneously analytic in structure and empirically
contingent.
Moreover, when considering Peirce and Vygotsky’s account of concept formation, much potential exists for individual freedom. In the case of Vygotsky, it has
been suggested that although the social dimension brings ‘form’ to ‘word meaning’, the activity of meaning creation is still heavily reliant on input from the
child’s individual ‘natural perceptions’. This means that even though a particular
‘word’ might find its origins in the discourse of others, the exact contents of the
concept may well differ for each individual. Different personal experiences will
ensure that individualised meanings will be formed; there is thus a high degree of
autonomy in a child’s concept formation. In a Peircean context, individual freedom is also present, but it is located elsewhere within his system. Freedom enters
concept formation when an individual initiates a ‘form’ (via an icon) and an initial ‘object of thought’ is created on an individual basis. Moreover, Peirce insists
that iconicity involves the imagination – ensuring that creativity is present at the
very beginning of sign formation. It is clear, therefore, that neither Vygotsky, nor
Peirce, rest their appeals to semiotic freedom on the nominalist idea that individuals are at liberty to ‘carve up’, or interpret, reality as they see fit.
Additionally, both Peirce and Vygotsky insist that the outcome of sign formation encourages human freedom. Through signs, they argue that the human
mind is able to establish a semiotic understanding of the world which would be
unattainable if it were dictated by ‘natural perceptions’. In line with the arguments
of Wheeler and Hoffmeyer, the form of semiotic reality that humans create is more

14.2 Peirce’s logic and semiotic freedom

225

complex than any formed from sensory inputs alone. But for Peirce, the pathway
to semiotic freedom is not via interpretation; instead, it is achieved because the
human mind creates new identities in the world (e.g., ‘thirds). These new identities exist in the world as interpretants, and they create semiotic ‘tools’ to understand reality. Likewise, Vygotsky invokes the ‘higher psychological processes’
which free the intellect from being a slave to its senses (Vygotsky 1987: 127).
Earlier in our discussion, it was also noted that McDowell (1994: 77) maintains that empirical experiences include the conceptual. He supports this view
with the suggestion that humans possess a ‘second nature’ that allows the
mind to create concepts which include more than is directly perceived. Given
our earlier discussion, it is notable that McDowell traces the notion of ‘second
nature’ back to Hegel and he relates it to the German concept of ‘Bildung’
(McDowell 1994: 84). Bakhurst, following McDowell, also explains this specific
concept in terms which reflect the mind’s ability to “move within a space of reasons” (Bakhurst 2011: 149):
As we mature, we acquire a ‘second nature’ through enculturation, or Bildung. Our second
nature includes conceptual capacities that enable us to move within the space of reasons,
so that we think and act in light of a conception of the world, rather than simply respond,
as non-human animals must, to biological imperatives.

And Bakhurst directly links the idea of ‘Bildung’ to educational learning theory
and the processes involved in forming one’s own identity (Bakhurst 2011: 7):
In the present context, the crucial aspect of McDowell’s position is that human beings are
not born into the space of reasons but are initiated into it by education, or Bildung, as he
puts it, adopting the evocative German term. The child is born a mere animal, as it were,
but acquires a ‘second nature’ as she develops conceptual capacities that put her in touch
with reality in experience. She thereby becomes a conscious rational being – a person.

The German notion of ‘Bildung’, therefore, reinforces the claim that concept formation, as framed by Peirce, has the capacity to establish human freedom. By
developing concepts that allow individuals to understand the world semiotically, human beings can begin to act autonomously.
In the context of their Hegelian influence, Peirce and Vygotsky would almost certainly subscribe to McDowell’s notion of ‘Bildung’. Both may quibble
with Bakhurst’s modern emphasis on ‘enculturation’, but they would agree that
‘Bildung’ allows the individual to create a conceptual world more complex than
one founded on stimulus and response.54 Peirce would also reject the idea that

54 Richard Rorty also highlights the notion of Bildung in his “Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature”. But he reframes the concept as ‘edification’ (Rorty 1980: 360). As such, Rorty links it

226

14 Peircean semiotics and learning theory

such semiotic freedom is founded on the ability to interpret sense data residing
on the ‘glassy essence’ of the mind. Rather, he would maintain that such freedom
is established through the mind’s ability to create its own individual ‘objects of
thought’. Once formed by iconicity, signs pursue a ‘natural history’ and, through
their continuous development, the human intellect understands its semiotically
formed world.

with the idea of conversation, and discourse, and argues that “to see keeping a conversation
going as a sufficient aim of philosophy, to see wisdom as consisting in the ability to sustain a
conversation, is to see human beings as generators of new descriptions rather than beings one
hopes to be able to describe accurately” (Rorty 1980: 378). This is in line with Rorty’s own account of pragmatism (in section 13.1), but it is quite different from that of Peirce.

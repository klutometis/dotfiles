### Decision: Use git-crypt + set -a instead of pass show

**Context**: Considered using `pass show` directly in `.env-secrets` instead of storing encrypted values.

**Why we didn't use `pass show`:**
- GPG unlock timing: We unlock GPG lazily (first browser use), but `.zshenv` loads early
- Shell startup would hang waiting for GPG unlock
- Background processes/scripts can't prompt for GPG passphrase  
- Performance: Every new shell would call `pass` multiple times

**Why we chose set -a approach:**
- Cleaner than repetitive `export` statements
- Fast shell startup (no external calls)
- Works in all contexts (cron, scripts, etc.)
- git-crypt provides adequate security for this use case

**Implementation**: Used `set -a` / `set +a` in `.env-secrets` to automatically export all variable assignments without repetitive `export` keywords.
